<title> Indigenous Peoples� Rights to Culture and Individual Rights to Access
<abstract> Using the methods of philosophical analysis and concepts from moral and political philosophy Indigenous Peoples� human right to control access to their cultural information is defended. The concept of a �right� is delineated and different types of rights are differentiated. The method of an �overlapping consensus� is used. In attempting to articulate the moral foundation for Indigenous Peoples� rights to culture, we can start with justifications for limiting access that are already widely accepted within our society. These widely accepted justifications for controlling or limiting access to information include the claim that said information is (a) under copyright, (b) a trade or state secret, (c) harmful to some segment of society, or is (d) private or confidential. The moral grounds for each of these limitations on free access is explored. (a)-(c) are found to not provide an adequate ground for Indigenous People�s rights to control access to their culture. The cultural rights of Indigenous Peoples are defended as a form of group privacy. Two possible moral dangers of this defense of indigenous peoples rights to culture are considered. It is shown that on a properly nuanced understanding of the contours of the Indigenous Peoples� rights to group privacy, they do not give rise to either of these dangers.

<title> Information Dissemination and Information Assurance in Vehicular Networks: A Survey
<abstract> Vehicular networks aimed toward providing roadside services such as traffic alerts, estimated time to reach a destination, alternative routes, and in general improve the efficiency and safety on the road are emerging in both the United States and Europe. Information exchange in such networks occurs between vehicles (inter-vehicle communications) in an ad hoc manner and also with roadside base stations using so-called dedicated short range communication links. Research on technology related to vehicular networks is being conducted by many universities and is being widely reported in the mainstream media as well. Vehicular networks are thus expected to become an important part of community networks of the future. In this paper we will survey the different types of dissemination of information and the assurance of such information in vehicular networks. The paper will discuss the architecture of vehicular networks, classify different types of information exchange (safety, traffic related, and content) and different methods of information exchange (opportunistic exchange of resources between vehicles, vehicle assisted data delivery, cooperative downloading of information, etc.). Then we discuss information assurance issues in vehicular networks and survey the solutions proposed for ensuring authenticity/integrity of information, location privacy of vehicles, eviction of faulty or misbehaving vehicles from the information network (e.g., using reputation), etc.

<title> Information Practices to Sustain Knowledge Building: The Case of the Virtual Math Teams Online Community
<abstract> The sustained knowledge building of virtual groups and online communities requires that coparticipants overcome a wide range of gaps in their interactions, especially in the context of long-term activity across multiple episodes and collectivities. Here we present an analysis of the collective information practices of virtual teams engaged in collaborative problem-solving as part of the Virtual Math Teams (VMT) online community. Our analysis aimed at understanding the information practices that teams employed to bridged the apparent discontinuity of their collaborative interactions (e.g. multiple collaborative sessions, teams, and problem tasks) and exploring the role that such bridging activity plays in their knowledge building over time.

<title> �Just Me in a Closet with a Computer�: Student Perceptions of Undergraduate Information Technology Programs
<abstract> Many institutions of higher education in the US are offering an information technology (IT) education program at an undergraduate level. So far, not many studies about this young academic program have explored students� perspectives. Students� perspectives are important input for educators to implement an IT education program that properly addresses students� needs. This study has investigated college students� perceptions and expectations for formal IT education in college through in-depth qualitative interviews. Interviewees were college students who were enrolled in courses offered from an IT minor program. This study has revealed that many college students feel that there is a void in college education in dealing with issues emerging from recent developments of IT. The interviewees indicated that the existing computer science program did not satisfy their needs. Students perceived that IT is something that they would have to confront in their future, and sought IT education regardless of their fondness for using and learning IT. By taking the IT minor, students tried to supplement their knowledge in their major and be better prepared for the fields that they would pursue after graduation.

<title> One iSchool's Ideas and Identity: Doctoral Training and Research at Rutgers-SCILS 1959-2007
<abstract> The proposed paper for presentation at the Third iConference addresses the �Nature and Scope of iSchools and iResearch� conference theme. It addresses this theme through report of an in-depth case study of the organizational, social, and intellectual evolution of one early pioneer in the iSchool movement, the Rutgers University School of Communication, Information, and Library Studies (SCILS). The paper first situates SCILS within the iSchool movement, examining its commonalities with and uniqueness from other members of the iSchool Caucus. Thereafter, the paper focuses specifically on the evolution of doctoral research and training, beginning with the program�s development as a disciplinary LIS program, followed by its transformation into an interdisciplinary program with the multidisciplinary merger that founded SCILS in 1982. The paper examines the evolution of ideas developed in dissertation research produced before and after the founding of SCILS interdisciplinary doctoral program in 1987. This includes analysis of the 269 dissertation produced in the program from 1961 to 2007. It compares and contrasts these periods in terms of ideas, methods and the influence played by dissertation supervisors (44 in all). Finally, it examines the influence of key organizational changes on the perceived identity of the school, its relationship with external constituencies, and its intellectual vision into the future.

<title> Prim Drift, CopyBots, and Folk Preservation: Three Copyright Parables about Art in the Digital Age
<abstract> This paper employs a series of case studies from the domains of digital arts and creative/experimental new media to elicit tensions and contradictions in the current state of copyright and intellectual property law. I pay particular attention to the role of the "pirate" as preservationist--rather than taint or corrupt, historically we know that piracy has helped guarantee the survival of important works of literature and art. Throughout, I insist that the humanist is not a dabbler or interloper in these matters; humanistic knowledge, particularly semiotics (the study of sign systems) has the potential to lend consistency and coherence to case law that is currently shot through with loopholes, contradictions, and dead ends. To that end, I also outline the potential of a center devoted to intellectual property law and humanities advocacy.

<title> Community Identity: Peer Prestige and Academic Hiring in the iSchools
<abstract> Exploring indicators of prestige in hiring networks as they relate to measures of prestige presented in peer ratings provides a new perspective on hiring and identity in the iSchools. This study examines a hiring network for the iSchool community and finds that the perception of prestige among iSchools, as represented by the US News & World Report (USNWR) graduate school ratings, may be improved by hiring choices that strengthen connections within the iSchool community, balanced by increasing the diversity of sources for new faculty. We compare the academic hiring network for the more establish Computer Science discipline to the recently emergent iSchools to explore the relationship between peer prestige and community identity. We also discuss additional observations from the data relating to the interdisciplinary diversity of the iSchool community.

<title> Community Informatics
<abstract> This proposal is for three papers which would form all or part of a panel presentation reporting current work in community informatics at three ischools. It complements the wildcard proposal submitted on community technology/information/informatics, which we are each also part of. If there are 1-2 other paper proposals in this area we would be glad to be combined in one session with them.

<title> Culture At the Interface: Collaborative Design and Information Management with Indigenous Communities
<abstract> Digital technologies provide the platform for both preserving and producing cultural knowledge and materials. Indigenous and other subaltern cultural perspectives on access, authority, and accountability in relation to cultural materials and knowledge are often marginalized in dominant narratives about the possibilities of digital technologies. Mainstream notions of �search� and �open access� �guided by Google�s mantra of providing universal access to everything�often leave out, or too easily blur, the lines between the multiple forms of technological translations and �other� knowledge/property systems. While digital technologies have much to offer to museums and other archival institutions and their many publics, their use needs to call in to question the viability of universal logics of search and access. Since the mid 1990s, museums, archives, libraries and especially land grant universities in the United States have recognized the need to direct their energies towards outreach to the indigenous communities whose materials they hold. Many archives have signed Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with indigenous communities promising access and support in retrieving materials. Digital technologies have allowed archives to produce online databases and expand their physical catalogs with digital repositories. At the same time, archival mandates to preserve information intersect with the capabilities of digital technologies to distribute information over networks. In the context of �information freedom� rhetoric and appeals for �access to knowledge� archives have found themselves at the center of information management debates and strategies for new models for information indexing and distribution. Museums and archives, now enlivened by the possibilities afforded by digital technologies, are at a crossroads in dealing with emergent information management systems and the cultural, ethical, and legal commitments they have to their multiple stakeholders. Making their materials �open� on the one hand, and working with divergent protocols for access and distribution on the other, In addition, physical distances, educational and linguistic barriers, and high levels of poverty have all made traditional archives unapproachable places for indigenous communities whose cultural materials and institutional histories are preserved within them. However, in the last ten years there has been a groundswell of activity lead by local indigenous communities in conversation with museums, archives, and technologists to incorporate indigenous cultural protocols into the parameters of archival sensibilities, design, and infrastructure. Projects around the world are seeking to integrate indigenous protocols into their informatics. The papers in this panel focus on collaborative efforts between museums, archives and local indigenous communities in Australia and Native North America to create digital archival systems informed by indigenous practices and protocols. The panel members come from diverse academic and technological backgrounds representing the Fine Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. Their work is informed by interdisciplinary concerns shaping scholars' understandings of the practical uses of digital technologies for underrepresented groups and the collaborative ways in which technology can be leveraged in service of cultural differences. The first paper (co �presented by the principal investigator and software designer) based on ten years of collaborative work with Warumungu community members in Australia�s Northern Territory, examines the production of an indigenous community digital archive and its internal search functionality. The Mukurtu Wumpurrarni-kari archive, installed in the community in August 2007, leverages Warumungu protocols for the reproduction, distribution, and access to cultural materials and their associated knowledge within the design and structure of the archive. A series of restrictions and �sharing protocols� �designated by the Warumungu community�drives the searching, sorting and sharing of all materials in the system. The archive, thus, challenges dominant narratives of openness and accessibility in relation to intangible cultural materials and acts as a practical solution to issues of preservation, access, and distribution that face indigenous people globally. The second paper describes a NSF-funded initiative which involves a direct partnership with the Zuni nation of New Mexico and the Cambridge (UK) Digital Museum Initiative. This partnership involves the study of how digital objects of excavated cultural materials can become the bases for indigenous engagement, and stimulate the release of indigenous and cross-cultural voices into the larger world of how digital systems are developed. It questions the assumptions that all �information is free� and should be widely disseminated without a sense of bounds, authorship, or culturally-specific forms of reception. Moreover, it questions the pre-existing classification systems for digital libraries and museums and argues for a more participatory model. Finally, it investigates the possibilities of creating information commonses based around diverse voices that indigenize processes of tagging, blogging, and commenting.

<title> The d-school in the i-school: HCI and Design Research
<abstract> In the context of a campus-wide strategic planning process, we have been asked to frame the special role of Penn State's Center for Human-Computer Interaction (CHCI) within the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST). Our response is that HCI should fulfill an important role as a focus for design research within our i-school. As support for this response we explore the following propositions: 1. Design research and design science are essential to i-schools. 2. HCI is historically, currently, and inherently a design science of the just right sort to contribute to i-schools. 3. Other constituencies/subunits of i-schools (CS, IS, LIS, STS) are not design sciences, but benefit from organizational proximity of HCI design research. In this brief paper, we sketch the argument entailed by these propopsitions. Our objective is to better understand and articulate the role of HCI and design research in i-schools.

<title> Designing e-Learning Games on Cellphones to Promote Language Learning and Literacy in the Developing World
<abstract> Literacy is one of the great challenges in the developing world. Even more challenging is the tension between regional and �world� languages � that economic opportunities are often closed to those who are literate only in a regional language. India for instance is a country with 22 regional and two �national languages� Hindi and English. But for most practical purposes, English is the language of economic opportunity. It is the language of instruction in private schools and all universities, a large fraction of business and government, and the language which is driving India�s service economy � the fastest growing in the world. Fluency in English can almost be equated with membership in the middle and upper classes [6]. The value of English is widely recognized by ordinary Indians [15], and it is the poorest citizens who are lobbying most strongly to expand English teaching. A recent article states that mastery of English is the �single most influential factor that determines access to elite educational institutions, and hence to important avenues of economic and social advancement� [9]. More broadly, the literature [e.g. 6], our conversations with development professionals in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and further experiences in the field indicate that a large proportion of low-income people want to improve their command of an appropriate �world language.� English is certainly one of these, as is Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. But even in countries where such a language is an official �national language,� many speakers (inevitably the least empowered) have a different native language, and many regional languages (let alone dialects) are often spoken. In India, Hindi and English are official �national languages,� but Hindi is native to only 20% of the population. �World language� fluency opens the door to further education, a larger regional (or world) marketplace, to �new economy� outsourced jobs, and often improves access to government, health and legal services. Our current work concentrates on ESL (English as a Second Language), but we believe many of the lessons will transfer to other �WSL� (World language) learning challenges. Unfortunately, formal English teaching in public schools is not succeeding, and it is far out of reach to the large numbers of children who are not able to attend school regularly. From the literature [e.g. 1] and our fieldwork in the poorest state of India, two significant factors stand out: irregular school attendance owing to the need for students to work in fields, homes, etc., and the preparation of local teachers, who themselves have very poor training in English. Regional schools typically have no �English teacher,� rather a handful of teachers who cover everything. In our 3 years of fieldwork, we have usually been unable to communicate with local teachers in English and have relied on interpreters. At the same time, high technology � in the form of cellphones � are being used by Indians at all economic levels. India is the largest market for cellphones worldwide, and the majority are now being bought by illiterate and semi-literate users. And a growing percentage of these phones feature advanced multimedia capabilities for photos and gaming. We argue that these devices are a perfect vehicle for new kinds of informal (out-of-school) language learning. All these factors create an extraordinary opportunity: to dramatically expand English skills in young Indians, which is the fastest way to open the doors for employment and further education. While our PAPER ABSTRACT � iConference 2008 work can be integrated with, and can complement the school English curriculum, the greatest opportunity is in out-of-school learning. The Indian children we studied, even those with work commitments for the family, spent an hour or so daily playing with friends, and several hours watching television. We believe that ESL learning games on cellphones can address the above challenges. Games have well-known �immersive� properties � that is, the learner experiences themselves as being �inside� the game. Games continually challenge players to develop new skills, and reward their acquisition. Players often spend long hours in games which allows them to develop advanced skills. Games can be social experiences which encourage communication with other players. And finally, games can be designed to mirror the real-world games that children play, providing them with tools and encouragement to use English recreationally outside the electronic game. Leveraging e-learning games for education in developing regions is not far-fetched. At least two non-government organizations, Pratham and the Azim Premji Foundation, have used computer games in their initiatives for children in the urban slums and rural areas of India respectively. Most importantly, a large-scale evaluation by Pratham1 showed significant gains on mathematics test scores from playing computer games that target math learning [2]. It is plausible that similar learning outcomes can be replicated using mobile games for ESL. In this paper, I introduce my dissertation work, which is now in its 4th year. It is informed by six rounds of fieldwork over three years with children living in the urban slums and rural areas of India. Our total time actually in the field is over six months. A goal of these field studies was to learn first-hand about the everyday learning contexts of the above children as part of a broader needs assessment. Another objective was to examine the feasibility of our ideas for technologyassisted learning, by piloting off-the-shelf software and early designs of our mobile applications on a very small scale with children from the urban slums and villages. Building on the systems requirements that we have learned iteratively from these studies, we are completing a final round of design and prototyping in Fall 2007 in preparation for a year-long deployment in 2008. Rural children displaying �You win!� screens from two cellphone games that we have designed. Success in these games, and mastery of the technology, was a considerable incentive and source of pride for these children. These kinds of behaviors were repeated over and over. 1 A longitudinal randomized experiment over more than two years with over 10,000 urban slums students. PAPER ABSTRACT � iConference 2008 Since our previous findings are already published, I will only review those games that we have designed so far and their learning outcomes. Instead, in this paper, I want to focus on meta-issues related to the project�s design methodology and its interdisciplinary nature. In particular, I want to draw attention to the challenges of doing information systems research in this highly difficult domain and offer strategies based on how I would undertake a project in this domain differently if I had to do it a second time. The rest of this paper addresses the following issues: � What is an effective model for multidisciplinary collaboration? While the most conventional approach is to assemble a specialist from each domain to form a team, we have learned that specialists in their respective areas are not always able to relate to the unique problem that lies at the intersection of these multiple areas of expertise. I have often found myself acting as the �interpreter� between computer programmers and curriculum developer in my team. More importantly, I will describe the theoretical frameworks that I drew upon from second language acquisition [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 16] and game studies [8, 13, 14, 17], and how my knowledge of both areas (to a certain degree) in addition to human-centered design made it possible for me to perform the essential �conceptual footwork� for integrating them in our elearning game designs, even as I relied on our curriculum developer for her practical experience in teaching English in India. � How can we develop competencies across disciplinary boundaries that make interdisciplinary work possible? Here, I will trace my intellectual development from my initial schooling in computer science and human-computer interaction to my realization that the problem I am confronting in my dissertation actually belongs to the education domain, and my subsequent socialization in the School of Education to learn their �trade.� � What are some appropriate approaches for conducting cross-cultural research in information systems? While ethnographic methods are critical for understanding the practices and beliefs of a community, culture is a dynamic phenomenon that changes quickly especially in the face of rapid technology uptake (e.g. cellphones) in emerging regions. I will cite my experiences from an international development project in Africa involving handheld technology to argue that conducting feasibility studies with multiple user communities is necessary for revealing our cultural assumptions. In particular, I will support this claim by describing the differences in how children in North and South India play our games differently. � What data collection challenges are there with users in developing regions who lack the exposure to technology and literacy levels for them to articulate their thoughts meaningfully so as to be directly useful for technology design? We have found that while it is difficult to obtain useful data from child users other than by observing them use the technology, we have obtained useful feedback by showing our designs to highly educated, local informants who know these children well as caregivers or educators. Similarly, the mundane obstacles in conducting fieldwork with local communities with the help of interpreters offer clues to ingrained beliefs and deeper patterns of behavior that affect technology use. I will describe a few of these behaviors that we have observed.

<title> Discipline Formation and the Field of Information
<abstract> The field of information as expressed in the iSchool Caucus is in many respects a conglomeration of disparate elements. It includes, for example, elements of several major traditions of information organization (commonly expressed as service professions) and the social institutional ties and contexts that some of them entail. In addition the field has also gathered under its umbrella an impressive array of such other elements as aspects of cognitive studies, social studies of the users and use of information, studies and services related to the Internet and World Wide Web, digital libraries and other systems that have no particular social institutional setting, digitization initiatives, not least among which are growing museum and digital archives movements, studies related to information systems of all kinds (e.g., interface design, usability testing, security), social issues of information property and rights, and the entire array of informatics initiatives, to name only some of the whole. Within this enlarged context, one issue of significance is the role of discipline formation, where the latter refers to efforts to identify a fundamental phenomenon related to larger core professional activities and explain aspects of that phenomenon through scientific methodology and objectivity. The purpose of this paper is to use two examples of discipline formation within traditions of information organization (Bibliography and Computerized information storage and retrieval) as a basis for enriching and provoking our contemporary understanding of discipline formation within the field of information. As such, it focuses on the fourth review criterion of the iSchool Caucus program: �develops intellectual geographies in which attendees can learn about intellectual domains not their own but part of the multi-disciplinary iSchool space.�

<title> Event-Driven Productivity Infrastructure
<abstract> The world of information technology is currently experiencing the parallel emergence of two separate paradigms, Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) and Productivity Infrastructure (PI). Each of these constructs has unique portent for the ways in which people interact with data and applications. However, there is also an exciting potential for the two constructs to work together in an integrated, synergistic fashion. EDA is an approach to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that creates an �enterprise nervous system,� aware of changes in state that occur within applications, databases, as well as the outside world by publishing state information through XML to a message backbone, such as an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Event listeners, also connected to the ESB, distribute state change data to Service-oriented applications for processing and reaction, including human interactions. The EDA approach to enterprise architecture offers advantages in agility and segregation of concerns that benefit the utility of information systems. Productivity infrastructure (PI) is an umbrella term to describe people�s and organization�s increasingly connected and synergistic use of phone, email, Internet, PDA, PDA, intranet, extranet, and desktop productivity applications. What was once a collection of essentially siloed productivity technologies and work flows � phone calls, emails, searching the Web, creating documents, using a PDA, and so on � are now merging into a combined infrastructure that drives personal and organization productivity. In brand name terms, productivity infrastructure is integrating the functionality of product sets such as Microsoft�s Office System, Cisco�s VOIP solutions, IBM�s Lotus suite, and Google�s Docs and gMail services, just to name a few. This paper explores the potential integration of EDA with productivity infrastructure. Events that originate from applications in the EDA can be published to individual human users, or collaborative groups operating in the productivity infrastructure. The integration has the potential to connect real time operations of an enterprise with Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs and wikis, as well as a range of mobile computing technologies, in addition to standard portal interfaces. The paper focuses on the ways that productivity infrastructure empowers the human thinking and decision making that is often implicit in the process flow of an EDA. It looks at scenarios where EDA-PI integration can improve the speed, quality, and cost effectiveness of end users in a large enterprise environment. Further, the paper will examine the potential for real time human activities to become events themselves, which can flow in the other direction and drive application functioning in the EDA.

<title> An Exploration of the Life Cycle of eScience Collaboratory Data
<abstract> The success of eScience research depends not only upon effective collaboration between scientists and technologists but also upon the active involvement of information scientists. Archivists rarely receive scientific data until findings are published, by which time important information about their origins, context, and provenance may be lost. Research reported here addresses the lifecycles of data from ecological research with embedded networked sensing technologies. A better understanding of these processes will enable information scientists to participate in earlier stages of the life cycle and to improve curation of these types of scientific data. Evidence from our interview study and field research yields a nine lifecycle phases, and three types of lifecycle depending on the research goal. Findings include highlighting the impact of collaboration on the research processes and potential phases during which the integrity of the captured data is compromised.

<title> I-School Curricula: How Wide? How Deep?
<abstract> The emerging discipline we call Information Science is shown to fit among its neighboring disciplines. After proposing any aca-demic discipline�s six levels of abstraction, and using them to define curricular �depth,� detailed investigation reveals that IS butts against different neighboring disciplines at different levels. Then, after proposing IS� six sub-disciplines, they are shown not only to have different distributions across their levels of abstract-tion, but also to butt up against different neighboring disciplines. An I-School�s role as a �professional school� is factored into this discussion. Curricular �width� is defined as how close a curriculum should get to its near neighbors. Then, �holes� are identified in the spaces between the I-disciplines and their neighbors. These holes represent areas of human knowledge, which are typically ex-cluded from all the academic disciplines at most universities. It is argued here that I-Schools should strive to fill those holes by expanding their curricular width.

<title> I-Schools: Mice Roaring or the Future is Now Arriving?
<abstract> Through this essay we develop an argument for supporting the growth of I-Schools by building on the literature and concepts of institutions. We first argue that I-Schools, and the I-School movement, can be seen as engaging in a process of institutionalization. That is, they are seeking each and collectively to become self-sustaining and enduring social units. To support this argument we draw on the literatures regarding institutions and institutionalization. We do so to help clarify what those involved in the I-School movement might need to do to encourage the process of I-Schools becoming become enduring and self-replicating forms of organization in the contemporary university milieu. The literature on institutions and institutionalizing is vast, active, and multi-threaded. In this essay we draw from, but do not summarize or extend this work. We draw on concepts from institutional theory to frame our thesis: what can those involved in I-Schools do to encourage the growth and legitimization of these scholarly institutions?

<title> Understanding Information Ethics and Policy: Integrating Ethical Reflection and Critical Thinking into Policy Development
<abstract> The development and implementation of information policies must begin with an understanding of underlying values, such from different cultural perspectives and points of view. As Capurro reminds us: �As a self-referential process ethics is an unending quest on explicit and implicit use of the moral code, that is to say of respect or disrespect, with regard to individual and social communication. . . .There is, indeed, no unbiased ethical observer. (Capurro et al. 2007, 21). In her work on ethical warrant, Berghtol has noted the importance of understanding context (Beghtol 2002). Her concept of �cultural hospitality� provides a theoretical framework for the ethical warrant of knowledge representation and organization systems, and it helps in representing new knowledge and organizations systems and for revising existing systems, and the diverse cultures to which each individual belongs. Using these two foundations, this paper provides an overview of some of the critical information ethics issues challenging policy makers in government and in organizations. Then, building on policy frameworks and several models for ethical reflection and critical thinking, the paper will describe briefly a case-based learning approach with a model for critical thinking for a proposed undergraduate course on Information Ethics and Policy.

<title> Whose data do you trust? Integrity issues in the preservation of scientific data
<abstract> Integrity of content is a generic issue in curation and preservation, but has not been extensively studied in relation to scientific data. Data are now being seen as an important end product of scholarship in themselves. In this paper, we will discuss data integrity issues in relation to environmental and ecological data, and the implications of these issues on the development of data digital libraries. For users to trust and interpret the data in scientific digital libraries, they must be able to assess the integrity of those data. Criteria for data integrity vary by context, by scientific problem, by individual, and a variety of other factors. The goal of this research is to identify functional requirements for digital libraries of scientific data, encompassing both technical and social factors that can affect data integrity. Mechanisms to ensure data integrity have to be present at each stage in the data life cycle, from data collection to data preservation and curation. The implications of our research on data integrity are multi-fold for the iSchool research community, and we hope to promote discussion of these issues.

<title> In the Spirit of Collaborating
<abstract> A field is judged by the questions it addresses. We believe that the i-field is at a critical juncture that is defined by increasing standards for profound, value-added insight as technology becomes more ubiquitous. While we see value in focusing on the "I" more than the "T" in IT, we believe that profound insight will only come through a deeper understanding of the intersection among human beings, information and technology. We see the basic goal of our field as helping to facilitate interactions among individuals, groups and "information" through more informed design of technology. We assume that human beings are fundamentally social beings and both information and technology to be artifacts of human experience proffered in the spirit of collaborating. We begin with a discussion of collaborating and communicating behaviors which are inherently linguistic (broadly cast) and - we believe, by definition - functional in nature. This position is logically prior to artifacts or any technology associated with the creation, dissemination, storage, retrieval or other processing of �information.� We argue, for example, that it is insufficient for our field to bound a domain after artifacts are created � we must become engaged in the creation of artifacts, specifying how the artifact will be useful to the user (either at present or in the future), and for which problems/situations the artifact is pertinent. If one assumes an active user focused on addressing their own needs as well as those of others--as opposed to a more passive stance generally made by many of the traditional behavioral fields--then insight into artifact creation, use and re-use will not only result in profound insights into the human condition, but more informed system design. We humbly invite you to collaborate with us in this endeavor. We feel that it is not only critical to intensify this discussion, but both timely and necessary.

<title> Understanding del.icio.us Tag Choice Using Simulations
<abstract> Understanding how users choose tags can help researchers better understand how tagging systems can be used and how to design better tagging systems for the future. We developed a simulation of del.icio.us, a popular so- cial bookmarking tool, that allowed us to simulate users choosing tags using one of four possible strategies for tag choice found in the literature. We then compared the resulting tag choices with empirical data retrieved from del.icio.us to determine which tag choice strategies would result in choices most similar to those seen in the real world. We were able to rule out three of the strategies as unlikely to be the primary means by which tags are chosen on del.icio.us.

<title> Privacy and Participation in Ubiquitous Information Systems: Information Ethics when Mobile Phones are Sensors
<abstract> Ubiquitious information systems hold increasing promise for widespread participation in data collection and dissemination. Common and abundant devices such as mobile phones can sense and record data such as location, sound, and images. These systems can facilitate community participation in basic and applied research, improvement of quality of life, social change, self-reflection, and creative expression. But the design and use of these tools also pose new challenges for privacy, data security, and ethics. This paper explores responsible approaches to the design of systems for ubiquitous digital capture. The authors include an Information Studies researcher working alongside computer scientists and engineers from the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS). This ongoing partnership pairs ethical frameworks developed within Information Studies and Science and Technology Studies with system design expertise and concrete, real-world challenges. For example, CENS is developing a platform to share activity inferences generated with geospatial data from mobile phones to assess personal environmental impact. CENS is also exploring systems for capturing and sharing data about neighborhood walkability and other community assets. The ongoing research detailed in this paper investigates how such ubiquitous sensing projects can conscientiously collect personal data for social science and participatory research applications.

<title> Reconsidering the Practical Application of Facets on the Web
<abstract> The term facet has become an increasingly common part of the discourse about useful components of contemporary information infrastructure. The facet approach to browsing or navigation as a way to scaffold resource discovery and access seems to be intuitively accessible to practitioners who may integrate this concept into the practice of Information Architecture or the design of a Knowledge Management system (La Barre, 2006). Facets seem to function equally well on e-commerce sites and in online library catalogs using content browse, search or management systems provided by vendors such as Endeca or open source solutions such as Koha or solr. This paper discusses preliminary results of a survey of a stratified random sample of 200 websites that were part of an earlier examination in 2005 of the use of facets on websites. Changes in facet use over a two and a half year period were noted using a content analytical protocol tested during the previous study (La Barre 2006). Websites with evidence of facet use are compared with a set of newly implemented �faceted� online library catalogs. Future research directions are also discussed.

<title> Reframing Book Publishing in the Age of Networking
<abstract> This paper presents preliminary results of an on-going examination of book publishing practices emerging through the complex interaction of technological, economic, and socio-cultural factors in the networking environment of the Internet. The theoretical framework guiding the study is a diachronic definition of book publishing proposed by Thomas R. Adams and Nicolas Barker in �A New Model for the Study of the Book,� first published in A Potency of Life: Books in Society, by the British Library in 1993. The Adams/Barker definition of publishing focuses on �the initial decision to multiply a text or image for distribution,�. In this paper, we propose what we intend as a friendly amendment to their definition: for our purposes, a book publisher is an individual or a collective that makes the initial decisions and arrangements for multiple copies of books to be publicly available for distribution. The methodology for this work was to study a purposive sample of book publishers found on the Internet that fit our definitional framework. Our final sample, which we call emerging publishers, is just under 300 publishers. This sample was divided into three categories: Category I: Book Publishing Entities; Category II Author as Publisher and Category III Channels to Market. Each category is sub-divided, defined and described. Tables are included which show the publishers in each category. The paper concludes with observations across categories about format, shifts in publishers� roles, standards of publishing practice, costs, and discovery, reception and reading and survival.

<title> The Role of e-Infrastructures in the Transformation of Research Practices and Outcomes
<abstract> In this paper, we examine transformations that have taken place in e-Research, and address the potential for additional transformations as e-Research develops and matures. The notion of a transformation in e-Research can operate on many levels: transformations in the tools used to conduct research, transformations in projects that enable new types of e-Research, transformations to ordinary scientific practice, transformations in the types of scientific questions that can be asked and able to be asked, and transformations in the scientific imagination. While much of the current rhetoric implies that e-Research will transform the very nature of science, other types of less-pervasive transformations are more evident at these relatively early stages in the development of e-Research infrastructures, and some evidence supports the idea that continuity has been more common in the ordinary scientific practice of e-Research rather than transformation. The data from this paper draws on the work of the Oxford e-Social Science project (OeSS).

<title> The Role of the Arts in an iSchool Education
<abstract> Professional education in Information Schools is predominantly technical and based on a rational, scientific way of thinking about the world. In this essay we make the argument that experience and interaction with the arts � aesthetic experience � should play an important role in the education of information professionals. Our discussion of the role of the arts in an iSchool education is structured around three basic ideas. First, we argue that the arts offer a pathway into complementary mode of thinking and knowing that is not only highly beneficial for the technical professions, but may also be important for the development of a competitive future work force. We refer to this as an artistic mode of knowing, and we discuss both terminology and the characteristics in this section. Second, we build on the ideas of Grant and others that focus on the organizational and societal importance of collaboration among individuals with diverse specialized knowledge. We describe how the skills needed for successful interdisciplinary collaboration are increasingly drawing on both ways of knowing. Third, we argue that much of the work done by information professionals has more in common than would first appear with the work done by design professionals and creative and performing artists, and thus is amenable to the pedagogical techniques employed in those fields. We conclude by offering specific iSchool examples of arts-based pedagogy and include suggestions for incorporating these ideas into an existing curriculum.

<title> The Social (Tagging) Act of Reading
<abstract> On Flickr, a Web-based service for managing and sharing digital images, reading and tagging come together in ways that reveal how people -- as individuals organizing their own photographs as well as making them available for discovery by others -- think about reading when they attempt to depict it in images and in words. In this pilot study of the tags assigned to a sample of 100 photographs tagged with the terms book and reading, only 80 of the 561 total tags were used more than once. The broad range of unique tags suggests an idiosyncratic approach to labeling that makes it difficult to draw conclusions about images of reading. Consequently, additional searches were conducted on Flickr and the results are reported and interpreted. The paper concludes with a discussion of proposed follow-up research.

<title> Taylor�s Value-Added Model: Still Relevant After All These Years
<abstract> This paper is an effort to reacquaint the information field with the work of one of its pioneers: Robert S. Taylor and his Value-Added Model. Taylor�s Value-Added model (1986) was a broad and ambitious effort to provide a unified framework for focusing on user needs and preferences in evaluating and designing information systems. Although developed in the early 1980s�before the wide-spread adoption of the microcomputer, and well-before the Internet and web�based technologies that have so changed our lives�the model holds up remarkably well in terms of explaining why various systems and systems attributes are useful and desirable or not.* The Value-Added Model seeks to explain what users want, why they want them, and how systems are able to meet (or not meet) those needs? �What do users want from information systems that would enable them to perform better, however �better performance� is defined in their context?� (Taylor p. 55) This paper updates Taylor�s work in light of dramatic developments over the past 20 years and demonstrates how the model remains highly applicable and valuable in both research and practical contexts across the interests of ischools. Robert �Bob� Taylor is well-known for his contributions to library and information science. His 1968 paper, �Question Negotiation and the Reference Process,� (Taylor 1968) was one of the first works to emphasize a user and information perspective. It remains one of the most cited works in the history of library and information science.� Taylor was also a visionary and pioneer in the movement that led to the formation of information schools. In the mid-1970s, he assumed the deanship at Syracuse, changed the name to the School of Information Studies and launched their doctoral program and later the Master�s in Information Resources Management. Taylor finished his career with his work on the Value-Added Model. The goals of this paper are: (1) To reintroduce the field to Taylor�s model. (2) To suggest revisions to the model based on our experience and our interactions with information professionals and graduate students. (3) To demonstrate the widespread applicability of the modified model in current contexts to better understanding users, information, systems, as well as the scope of the information field. (4) To offer recommendations for further work to develop and use the modified model. * We state this from personal experience in using Taylor�s model in formal presentations and graduate courses. � For example, a quick �Cited Reference Search in the ISI Web of Knowledge notes 255 citations for the 1968 College & Research Libraries paper. Eisenberg/Dirks 2008 p. 2 The Taylor model (both the original and our proposed modified model) helps explain the motivation of users, why certain systems and systems features perform so well in meeting user�s needs or not (e.g., electronic spreadsheets, email, Google, Amazon, GUI, the Web, social networks).

<title> Technical Authorship: Refiguring the Designer-user Conflict and the Visioning of Collective Technical Futures
<abstract> This paper argues for the application of authorship analysis to technology design. It extends techniques used in Science Studies to investigate scientific authorship in order to define a concept of technical authorship. To illustrate the potential of this approach, authorship analysis is applied to particular prescriptive software design methodologies including Participatory Design and Agile Software Development. The results of this analysis are the recognition that: a) design methodologies are rhetorics of authorship, b) the designer-user relationship can be seen as a conflict of contested authorship, and c) this conflict can be seen within the tensions in the figuration of the user and the designer along a subject-object continuum. �Figuration,� a technique used by Donna Haraway, brings about a new understanding of the centrality of the user in the design process as well as the role of the designer as the contested author technical futures. The implications suggest that design researchers might use authorship as a new approach to the politics of design by re-figuring the designer and user rather than collapsing the distinction between these roles.

<title> Tracing Transnational Flows of IT Knowledge Through Open Exchange of Software Development Know-How
<abstract> Information technology (IT) is often promoted as a socially and culturally agnostic tool that will allow emerging economies to leap into the digital age and reap the wealth that accompanies it. But in addition to the programming language, software tools, and books, know-how is needed to turn bright ideas into innovative, marketable solutions. This know-how can only be acquired from experience or from other IT developers. An effective means for sharing know-how is through an open exchange, which we characterize as a space where interested people can learn, critique, and contest ideas. It�s a locale that is defined in terms of activity, rather than geography, technology, or membership. We use open exchanges of know-how as an analytical lens to example historical examples and contemporary instances. While conducting fieldwork in India, we observed open exchange occurring at Barcamp Bangalore. It is through these exchanges of know-how, rather than the transmission of tools or software artifacts that IT knowledge flows between international locales. We conclude this paper with a discussion that is mutually informed by contemporary practice and historical configurations.

<title> Behavioral Parameters of Trustworthiness for Countering Insider Threats
<abstract> This proposal is intended to examine human trustworthiness as a key component for countering insider threats in the arena of corporate personnel security. Employees with access and authority have the most potential to cause damage to that information, to organizational reputation, or to the operational stability of the organization. I am interested in studying the basic mechanisms of how to detect changes in the trustworthiness of an individual who holds a key position in an organization, by observing overt behavior � including communications behavior � over time. Rotter (1980) defines trust as a generalized expectancy - held by an individual or a group - which the communications of another (individual or group) can be relied upon. In this investigation, �trustworthiness� is defined as the degree of correspondence between communicated intentions and behavioral outcomes that are observed over time (Rotter, 1980 & 1967). The degree of correspondence between the target�s words and actions remain reliable, ethical and consistent, which its degree of fluctuation does not exceed observer�s expectations over time (Hardin, 1996). To be able to tell if the employee is trustworthy is thus determined by the subjective perceptions from individuals in his/her social network that have direct business functional connections, and thus the opportunity to repeatedly observe the correspondence between communications and behavior. This study adopts the concept of correlating data-centric attributions, as observed changes in behavior from human perceptions; as analogous to �sensors� on the network. The Attribution Theory is adopted in the experimental situations (the �leader�s dilemma� game) to extract indirect perceptions of trustworthiness toward a critical worker over time in a group dynamics (Kelley, 1973). The principles of distinctiveness, consensus and consistancy are applied in these experimental situations.

<title> Beyond the Digital Divide into Computer-Mediated Communications: A Content Analysis of the Role of Community Weblogs in Building Oldenburg's Virtual Third Places in Black America
<abstract> Although times change, there are certain human elements that survive through the ages. These elements include the need for expression, companionship, involvement, connection and information. The avenues by which humans engage in these social practices have evolved, and with the dawn of the Information Age we are seeing the emergence of new forms of computer mediated communication (CMC), with weblogs (or blogs) being a manifestation of this transformation. Some argue that within the on going information age in American society, no single individual is disconnected or separated from others due to the existence and prevalence of Information Communicative Technologies (ICT). These technologies have proved to be indispensable and are critical to communication between individuals, cultures and communities within the larger American society (Milne 2004). This paper deals with these Information and Communicative Technologies, more specifically how weblogs (or blogs) are used by African Americans on the positive side of the digital divide to participate in virtual communities to rebuild communicative aspects of community that have been lost in �real-world� communities. In addition, the paper will determine whether these virtual communities fit the description of �third places� as portrayed by Oldenburg (Oldenburg 1999). These �third places� arise out of a need for individuals to find a dependable, neutral place of refuge to gather and interact, away from first places (home) and second places (work), often conferring or dealing with issues that may considered too taboo for public discussion by the community at large. With this in mind the researcher identified an issue within the African American community that was of consequence, and yet was not being addressed due to individual or social pressures. The problem that presented itself was the lack of discussion and social support pertaining to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

<title> ChemXSeer: An eScience Web Search Engine and Repository for Chemistry
<abstract> E-science or cyberinfrastructure have become crucial for scientific progress and open source systems have greatly facilitated design and implementation. In chemistry, the growth of data has been explosive and timely and effective information and data access is critical [Atkins 2003, Hey 2006]. Many have argued that cyberinfrastructures for science are domain sensitive [Snow 2006] and many have been proposed. We have proposed and are developing the ChemXSeer architecture, a portal for academic researchers in environmental chemistry, which integrates the scientific literature with experimental, analytical and simulation datasets. ChemXSeer will be comprised of information crawled from the web, manual submission of scientific documents and user submitted datasets, as well as scientific documents and metadata provided by major publishers. Information crawled by ChemXSeer from the web and user submitted data will be publicly accessible whereas access to publisher resources can be provided by linking to their respective sites. Thus, instead of being a fully open search engine and repository, ChemXSeer will be a hybrid one, limiting access to some resources.

<title> The Collaborative Information Behavior of Middle School Students in Online Learning Environments: An Exploratory Study
<abstract> The emergence of social computing systems such as blogs and online communities is shaping people�s way of working, learning, and interacting with others. Teenagers and preteenagers are leading the transition �to a fully wired and mobile nation� (Lenhart, Madden, & Hitlin, 2005). A growing body of research indicates that today's young people, often referred to as the Millennial Generation or as �digital natives" (Prensky, 2001), are heavy users of social computing media and that much of their information seeking and socialization takes place via Instant Messaging (IM), text messaging, blogs, wikis, email, and the World Wide Web (DeBell & Chapman, 2006; Harris, 2005; Lenhart, Madden, & Hitlin, 2005; Rideout, Roberts, & Foehr, 2005). Although the study of human information behavior (IB) is a rapidly growing subset of library and information science research, most IB research has focused on studying individual behaviors. We need to understand better how people �need, seek, give, and use information� (Fisher et al, 2006) in groups and in the context of online communities that use social computing technologies as well. At the Virtual Math Teams (VMT) project (http://mathforum.org/vmt/), we are studying how middle school students work on math problems together and how they create and maintain online communities. As part of the VMT�s larger research agenda, this study explores how students collaborate on math problem solving in online learning environments and looks into how they identify and address their information needs during this process.

<title> �Community Innovativeness�: A New Perspective on Knowledge Creation
<abstract> Community Informatics (CI) is an emerging field of study that concerns itself with the design and use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) to enable and empower local communities (Gurstein, 2000). But while the intention of designing appropriate technologies to meet the needs of these communities may sound very ethical, the approach oftentimes lacks rigor. One of the key areas lacking attention is the relationship between community structure and knowledge generation. This lack of adequate work has led to the assumption that communities are social systems that need to adopt outside innovations developed by people in white coats. The problem is exacerbated with the advent of the new ICTs that are seen as panacea to community development issues. This poster presents a research proposal that values a deeper awareness of community structure as key resource for design and use of ICTs for community development. The study is interested in identifying the underlying structural properties and processes that motivate communities to take initiatives in generation new knowledge. The main question, however is, how best can researchers, practitioners and policy makers (interested in the application of ICTs for community development) approach this process? While the concept of �community� is still a site of contestation in general and specifically in CI, this study takes a geographic or spatial approach to community. The study also approaches innovation from user perspective (von Hippel, 2001) and identifies knowledge generation as key in community innovativeness. In other words, community innovation is a social process that leads to knowledge creation. It is the interplay between tacit and explicit knowledge. The study also recognizes the transformative power of the Internet in disseminating global codified knowledge to the developing and transitional countries (Stiglitz, 1999), but skeptical about its ability to unearth the �tacit� or �sticky� (Szulanski, 2003; Sevigny and Prevost, 2006) component of knowledge in these communities. Consequently, for the transformative power of the Internet to be evidenced in developing economies, there is the need to explore ways by which this sticky knowledge can be tapped and combine with the �transferred� codified knowledge to the benefit of its people. This study argues that the structure of a given community is a predictor of the innovativeness of that community. Community Innovativeness is the dynamic capability of a relatively stable geographic system consisting of networks of social organization interacting significantly with each other in an institutional setting to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge to meet the needs of the system. The model is driven by the theory of absorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Zahra & George, 2000); community development theory (Warren, 1978); community integration (Coleman, 1957; Aiken & Alford, 1970); theories of communication network (Monge & Contractor, 2003); and the dynamic theory of knowledge creation (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995: Szulanski, 2003).

<title> Conversation Repository for Participatory Librarianship
<abstract> The goal of this study is to model conversation data from digital reference services and reconstruct the processes of the reference interviews as a conversation repository. By doing so, I am hoping that the study will provide an infrastructure for applications such as an interactive information retrieval system, a question answering system, or a recommender system for information intermediaries. While the current study focuses on the digital reference conversation, observations may be generalizable, to a certain extent, to different online conversations such as blogs, question answering sites, social networking sites, or product review systems, and thus contribute to a wider range of knowledge sharing and knowledge creation through information technologies. This work is a part of the Participatory Librarianship research initiative, proposed by Lankes et al. (2006), which seeks an implementation of library as a facilitator of technology-enhanced human communication and knowledge creation, based on Gordon Pask�s Conversation Theory. (Pask, 1975, 1976)

<title> Cyber Java Monopoly: Game-based Approach of Collaborative Programming Language Learning
<abstract> Game-based learning is one of the modern pedagogical approaches beginning to gain attention in education. The intention of adopting games in learning is to offer an additional option for online teaching and to provide students with possibilities to acquire skills and competencies. The teacher�s perspective game-based learning motivates students to become active learners while offering alternative ways to interact and communicate with the system. On the other hand, it�s fun to learn by doing from students� points of view [1]. UniGame Project [2] tests diverse educational games in various subjects and promotes digital game-based learning in Europe. The field of Medicine [3][4] highlighted the usefulness of specifying problem scenarios which are placed within a game framework [5]. However, in traditional game-based learning teachers have to locate resources for the games and the creation of game stories and curriculum-relevant game content is an enormous workload for teachers and learning content providers [6]. Therefore, the question that we tempt to answer is: Do students learn more through highly engaged annotating activity? Is game-based learning a good and efficient instructional strategy for supporting programming language learning? Is it proper to apply game-based approach into collaborative programming language learning?

<title> Deriving Ontology from Folksonomy and Controlled Vocabulary
<abstract> Popular online tagging websites, such as Flickr, Technorati, and Del.icio.us, allow users to tag objects freely without constraints of any controlled vocabulary. The word �folksonomy� has been used to describe this type of grass-root taxonomies, which provides a rich source for building ontologies. Research has experimented with building ontology purely from user-generated tags, and the approaches have been focused primarily on statistical methods. Schmitz (2006) conducted a study of inducing an ontology from Flickr tags, which used statistical methods to detect subsumption pairs based on co-occurrences of tags. Heymann Carcia-Molina (2006) established a hierarchical taxonomy based on tags from Delicious and CiteULike respectively by using cosine similarity of tag vectors. Although a good source for building ontology, folksonomy has its disadvantage in representing object content. For example, the tags are subjective and their hyponyms are usually not indicated (Mathes, 2004). Relations between tags are unknown and useful information is missed in tags, therefore the unorganized status of tags affects retrieval of objects negatively. Folksonomies alone are not sufficient for building a comprehensive and high-quality ontology. Researchers have suggested using other sources such as WordNet and Wikipedia to assist ontology building from folksonomies (Damme et al., 2007). Contrary to folksonomies, controlled vocabulary is characterized by rigid structures and slow responsiveness to new terminology. But its systematic organization and careful formulation of terms and relationships would be complementary to the disadvantages of folksonomies. Online lexical resources and gazetteers as instances of controlled vocabulary appear to be promising approaches in using folksonomies for generating ontologies (Schmitz, 2006; Damme et al., 2007). While researchers are speculating this method, little research has been done to actually implement it to build ontology. In addition, building ontologies from a combination of both folksonomies and controlled vocabulary is rarely mentioned in previous works. This study is intended to fill the gaps between methodologies in using folksonomies to produce ontologies.

<title> Developing an Organizational Model and Technical Implementation Plan for Wireless Mesh Networks in Sao Tome and Principe, West Africa
<abstract> Community wireless networking initiatives have been envisioned and implemented with varying success both in the US and abroad. There are a variety of organizational models that municipalities, community organizations, individuals, businesses, corporations and grassroots movements are using to build, plan and implement wireless community networks. In developing countries the organizational, economic and technical challenges are even greater. Terrain, power requirements, and other technical challenges are secondary to the organizational challenges, community impact and social implications that such a technology infusion can bring. These needs present a great opportunity for Universities to complete research, help communities bridge the digital divide, and become part of the information society. Prairienet, a Community Informatics focused organization within the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has been partnering on action research projects with organizations and people in communities such as East St. Louis, IL and Paseo Boricua, Chicago for a many years. This has provided graduate students in Library and Information Science with opportunities to learn valuable technical and organizational skills, while assisting community groups achieving their community goals. Prairienet is now beginning to extend this model internationally through partnerships begun through former GSLIS graduate, Jorge Coelho of Sao Tome and Principe. Initial discussions on community goals with Sao Tomean community members and groups over the past two years have developed into several projects carried out by both GSLIS graduate students and those from the Architecture and Urban Planning schools. These early projects have benefited both Sao Tomean communities and the students engaged with the community members completing them. An early expressed goal of Jorge and other community members has been the desire to link locations with Internet access such as schools and libraries with community centers in nearby plantation towns in the mountains. Initial surveying of two possible sites and partial testing of open source mesh network hardware and software took place as a small part of Prairienet's summer 2007 trip. In response to the lessons learned from this testing, GSLIS student Chris Ritzo has begun work investigating the different organizational models being used in community wireless network initiatives, continued testing open-source mesh networking technologies in use or in development in the U.S. or internationally and comparing those models and technologies to organizational and personal contacts of the GSLIS/Prairienet Community Informatics initiative in Sao Tome, West Africa. This research will result in a paper detailing possible organizational and technical models for deployment of wireless mesh networks in Sao Tome and Principe. This might then be used by Sao Tomean community members and organizations in partnership with the University of Illinois/GSLIS groups to make that goal a reality, or as a starting point for further discussion and modification. This poster session will detail the work completed thus far, discussing possible organizational and technical models that could be used to implement wireless networking initiatives in Sao Tome and Principe.

<title> Federal Funding for Information Research
<abstract> Based on a literature search, interviews with program officers at federal funding agencies, and other documentation, this poster addresses the patterns of funding for information science research, focusing specifically on faculty in iSchools. The study examines several major funding agencies and their missions and funding priorities, and concludes with recommendations for increasing the chances of success in winning federal grants. Questions addressed in this study: Which agencies have contributed the most support? What initiatives have been supported, how has the emphasis on topics and issues changed, where are there gaps, and which initiatives are currently at the top of federal agencies� research agendas? How has the amount of funding fluctuated over the years, what factors have influenced the availability of federal dollars for LIS research, and what is the prognosis for the future? How are research agendas currently being set? Who is determining priorities? These and other questions are addressed with charts, tables, and other graphical displays showing trends and current priorities, which will invite questions and informal discussion.

<title> From Cultural Participation to Information Visualization: A New Framework for Old Knowledge Management Schemas
<abstract> The conference theme, �iFutures: Systems, Selves, Society,� calls for research to explore how cultural contexts and information systems affect society. One significant information research area that struggles to address the imperative for cultural sensitivity is knowledge management (KM). Many KM schemas envision meaningful organization of vast knowledge across multiple domains, but ongoing debate about their capacity to do so suggests these attempts fall short. Information research and education turns to other discourse communities, such as epistemology and semiotics, to enrich its approach. To rethink learning for iSchools, this poster presentation proposes innovating KM schemas to reflect archetypes of knowledge systems and information practices manifest in faith-based communities of practice (CoP). Exploring practice as meaning in particular context, this qualitative study aimed to balance Etienne Wenger�s (1998) duality of reification and participation processes. A content analysis of KM schema qua �hard� knowledge, across religious traditions revealed striking correlations between the conceptual components and spatial representation of knowledge in the mystical symbol systems of two religions commonly considered the most different � Hinduism (polytheism) and Judaism (monotheism). Subsequently, the researcher traveled throughout India, Israel, and Europe to locate communities that believe the schemas of the cakras in tantric Hindu philosophy and the sephirot of Kabbalah (Jewish philosophy) represent ultimate reality. To connect reification of KM with the tacit or �soft� knowledge that informs the everyday lives of religious mystics, the researcher intensively interviewed thirty-six kabbalists and tantrists from a snowball sample acquired via covert participation in communal worship with the Jewish CoP and by complete observation of the Hindu CoP. Findings suggest ancient KM schemas sustain cultural identity in the research and practices in the Indian and Jewish communities that still use them. In addition to this study�s implications for KM, there are also implications for information retrieval: the schemas� central structures are diagrammatically and conceptually identical to Roberts Taylor�s (1968, p. 182) early model of information needs. Findings suggest that implementation of an integrated system of faceted classification schemas based on the cakras and sephirot should be a new priority in knowledge organization and cultural information systems research and for information visualization applications.

<title> Group Maintenance Behaviors in Self-organizing Distributed Teams
<abstract> An important area of NLP is the study of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), which may assign a unique word sense to a word. There are different methods to implement WSD: one is the word sense based on the collocation of other words (Yarowsky, 1993), where nearby words provide strong consistent clues to the sense of a target word, conditional on relative distance, order and syntactic relationship; and the other is the word sense based on discourse (Gale et al, 1992), where the sense is consistent within any given document. Many experiments in recent years of both supervised (Leacock 1993) and unsupervised (Yarowsky, 1993) WSD algorithms have accomplished promising performance with a high precision rate. Another important area in the field of text mining (Lewis & Spark Jones papers) is document classification, which identifies one or more of several topic labels for a text document. A significant body of research has improved the results of document classification, with innovations in identifying document features as well as improving algorithms. In this study, we will use WSD as part of a method to create innovative features to represent the documents for classification task. With the help of WSD, a set of specially selected ambiguous words can be further distinguished by word sense clustering, in order to achieve better document classification.

<title> The Impact of Documentation on Secondary Data Use
<abstract> Organizing, managing information, and providing information services to users have been long traditions in information schools. Numerous researches have been done on the organization and use of books, journals, images, even audio and video resources. Social science raw data, on which many publications and scientific findings are based, are important information resources. But they have received inadequate attention from information schools in the past. This is partly because the secondary use of raw data was not a common practice in many academic fields. Facilitating data sharing has been a growing concern in recent years. In the United States, a law has been passed by the Congress to mandate the Office of Management and Budget to amend Circular A-110 to extend the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to "require Federal awarding agencies to ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public under the FOIA� (http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/fedreg/a-110rev.html). More and more funding agencies require grantees to share their research data to the public. We can expect that in the near future, more and more social science raw data will be available for public access and use. Thus, there needs to be more research about the organization, management and use of social science data. Secondary data use is defined this way: a user uses a data set, and the user is not involved in the production process of that data set. Three basic entities are involved in secondary data use: the data producers, data users, the data itself and associated documentation. Sometimes there is an intermediary between data producers and users. Intermediaries, such as data archives or data libraries, process the data to improve the quality of data and documentations, and disseminate data to users. Documentation is metadata of social science data. Similar to MARC records that help users to search and judge the relevance of books and journals, Dublin Core records help users to search and determine the relevance of Web resources. Documentation provides information necessary to search and judge the relevance of data, more importantly, they help users understand and use the data. The Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) identifies the following as necessary elements of good documentations: cataloging information, such as title, principal investigator, data producer, place and date of production, funding agency; description of how the data were collected and the data sources used; full description of sampling design, frame, and methods as well as sampling error; full variable and value labels, full details of all coding classifications; question text, full description of recoded and derived variables, frequencies of variables, fully documented weights with information on conditions under which they should be used; and details on file types and linkages among files. If available, data collection instruments and related bibliographies should also be provided.

<title> The Impacts of Gender and Initial Social Activities on Trust and Performance in CMC
<abstract> In recent years HCI researchers have made significant progress in understanding how different communication media influence people�s trust perceptions and task performance in virtual environments [1, 5]. In this research little attention has been paid to the effects of gender differences in communication in virtual environments. However, there is good reason to investigate the role of gender, given research in the discipline of communication studies that has shown gender effects in face-to-face and virtual communications. In communication studies, gender analyses have focused on patterns of communication involving status, power, and influence [3]. By contrast, this research aims to bring the gender factor into computer-mediated communication (CMC) from an HCI perspective, responding to central concerns of efficiency, effectiveness, and user perceptions. The primary objective of this research is to explore gender differences in synchronous computer-mediated communication with and without initial social activities. In particular, I ask whether initial social activities affect trust development and performance of male and female pairs in a social dilemma game. To this end, the research questions for this study are: 1) How does gender influence people�s trust development over multi-trials of a competitive task via the IM System? 2) How effectively does pre-task activity, i.e. social chat, help different gender pairings achieve higher levels of trust and better performance over multi-trials of a competitive task? 3) Is there a larger benefit of pre-task activity for males, who tend to be less trusting [4], than for females in doing a task which involves conflicts of interest? If the answer is YES, do males achieve the same level of trust as females? 4) Qualitatively, how do different gender pairings use language to communicate via the IM System and how does their language affect trust? In order to get answers for these questions, I measure three dependent variables: participants� post-task trust, participants� performance and behaviors during the task and the pairs� communication processes.

<title> Incentive Design for Home Computer Security
<abstract> People are the weakest link in security (Anderson, 1993). People write passwords on sticky notes on the screen. People don't patch their home systems and become botnet zombies. People choose whether to label a patch critical or just recommended. Our moti- vating insight is that these actions generally reflect motivated behavior in response to the configuration of incentives confronting individuals. Since behavior is motivated by the goals and preferences of the individual, this behavior can be altered by designing appropriate incentives. By carefully structuring the benefits received from using a technology, we can induce users to make choices that most benefit the system. Along with some colleagues, we are developing a methodology for incentive-centered design of technology systems. We are working to provide guidelines and examples of how to carefully structure benefits to induce appropriate user choices.

<title> Post-disaster Information Infrastructure: The 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake
<abstract> Government reports and members of the media blame information systems as the culprit of what has been characterized as faulty responses to disasters such as Virginia Tech and Hurricane Katrina. In the process they propose information and communication technologies (ICTs) as solutions to disaster response. Calls for new ICTs following recent American disasters reveal a poor understanding of the socially situated nature of ICTs. Disaster-related research does not expound a sophisticated understanding of ICTs either. As a consequence, information systems are seen as an unproblematic means of informing the right people with the right information at the right time. In my dissertation, I will challenge these simplistic notions of information systems as solutions to disaster response by proposing two case studies of �information environments� from the period following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. I will introduce an analytical framework from the social studies of information which situates information systems in the social environment. The theoretical construct, the �information environment,� is meant to overcome the limitations of studying ICTs from a purely technical perspective.

<title> A preliminary consumer health information-seeking (CHI-seeking) behavior model of physicians who treat elderly depressed patients (results from the pilot study of a dissertation proposal)
<abstract> Despite useful studies that report the information-seeking behaviors of physicians who use the Internet, or physicians� clinical information-searching skills (such as evidencebased medicine), little literature highlights physicians� consumer health informationseeking behavior. Where does a physician get information to give to the patient or to a caregiver? In a rapidly growing market of consumer health information, what does a physician offer patients today? This poster describes pilot research, methodology and expectations of a study designed to investigate information-seeking behaviors of primary care physicians who treat elderly depressed patients. A main objective is to reveal a correlation between what information is sought versus what is provided to a patient or caregiver. This study identifies a specific population, senior health consumers, and investigates the steps their front-line outpatient caregivers (primary care or family practice physicians) take in order to make sure their patients have the information they need to understand their illnesses and to take part in a shared decision-making process with regard to their treatment. The study attempts to uncover the consumer informationseeking habits of primary care physicians who see large populations of elderly depressed patients. Primary research questions include: 1. How are these physicians searching for consumer health information? 2. How are physicians responding to health information requests from their patients or caregivers? 3. Can a consumer health information-seeking model that is significant for the medical and LIS professions be constructed?

<title> Proposal of Document Classification with Word Sense Disambiguation
<abstract> An important area of NLP is the study of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), which may assign a unique word sense to a word. There are different methods to implement WSD: one is the word sense based on the collocation of other words (Yarowsky, 1993), where nearby words provide strong consistent clues to the sense of a target word, conditional on relative distance, order and syntactic relationship; and the other is the word sense based on discourse (Gale et al, 1992), where the sense is consistent within any given document. Many experiments in recent years of both supervised (Leacock 1993) and unsupervised (Yarowsky, 1993) WSD algorithms have accomplished promising performance with a high precision rate. Another important area in the field of text mining (Lewis & Spark Jones papers) is document classification, which identifies one or more of several topic labels for a text document. A significant body of research has improved the results of document classification, with innovations in identifying document features as well as improving algorithms. In this study, we will use WSD as part of a method to create innovative features to represent the documents for classification task. With the help of WSD, a set of specially selected ambiguous words can be further distinguished by word sense clustering, in order to achieve better document classification.

<title> Stability and Change in Self-organizing Technology-supported Groups: Evidence from Genres of Communication in Free and Open Source Software Development
<abstract> New organizations supported by information and communications technologies, such as open source software development and Wikipedia, have recently emerged with great and somewhat surprising success. These organizations are emergent, self-organizing and appear able to change and adapt as success breeds new challenges, all without undermining the creative| even emancipatory|collaborative experience. This abstract proposes a poster presentation for the iConference 2008, drawing on dis- sertation work in progress with an intended completion date of April 2008. Therefore the poster would present the conceptual framework, method and preliminary results at a time when the author can still incorporate feedback from the iSchool community. The dissertation work described in this proposal will further our understanding of the emergence, stability and change in the practices of self-organization, through a systematic historical study of two comparable Free and Open Source Software development projects. Speci cally it examines emergence, stabilization and change in the genres and genre-systems the projects use to communicate.

<title> Support Sense-making with Tools for Structuring a Conceptual Space
<abstract> This abstract describes the design of a sense-making tool that assists users to structure their conceptual space and create a task report from the conceptual structure. Sense-making involves the � recognition of a knowledge gap, � seeking for information, � analyzing and synthesizing information to create an understanding, and possibly � producing a task output: a report, decision, or other type of output. A typical sense-making task is for an intelligence analyst to gather, analyze, and synthesize information related to some political figure or event, and to make recommendations for action. Everyday sense-making tasks, although less complex, share certain characteristics with the example. Many people use information systems as sense-making tools. Standard information retrieval systems can support reasonably well the search for pieces of relevant information when the user can identify her information need or knowledge gap to certain extent. However, in order to make sense of the information they found, users need to understand the pieces of interrelated information, identify patterns, and build on their previous knowledge to create an updated understanding. Most sense-making tasks are characterized by the interplay of searching for information and creating a structured representation of the situation, problem, or domain. In difficult sense-making tasks, sense makers often use external more or less structured representations to store the information for repeated manipulation and visualization (Stefik et al., 1999). Users need sense-making tools that facilitate the creation of such conceptual structures. Research in the areas of education (especially learning theories), cognitive psychology, and information extraction all bring useful insights into sense-making research. This study aims to integrate findings from these areas and build on that basis to design a sense-making tool that assists users in creating and using external representations for sense-making. Some questions to be explored are: 1. How do users build the concepts and relationships in their conceptual models? 2. How can the tool support the co-existence and transformation of different formats in which users represent their mental models of concepts and relationships? 3. How can automatic or computer-assisted extraction of entities and relationships assist users in building a representation? 4. Does the framework of topical relevance types assist users in making connections between retrieved information and conclusions to be reached and in identifying types of information to search for?

<title> To Catch a Predator? The MySpace Moral Panic
<abstract> This paper is about moral panics over contemporary technology, which I call �technopanics.� I use two examples, the cyberporn panic of 1996 and the contemporary panic over online predators and MySpace, to demonstrate the links between media coverage and content legislation. In both cases, Internet content legislation is directly linked to media-fueled moral panics that concern uses of technology deemed harmful to children. This is of particular interest right now as an internet content bill known as the Deleting Online Predators Act, or DOPA, was debated last year in Congress, and a variant of this bill may pass in the future. DOPA would require filtering software on internet-connected computers in libraries and schools to block access to all "social software" sites, which would broadly include any website with communication features, including social networking sites, wikis, community forums, and online communities. The technopanic over �online predators� is remarkably similar to the cyberporn panic; both are fueled by media coverage, both rely on the idea of harm to children as the justification for internet content restriction, and both have resulted in carefully crafted legislation to circumvent First Amendment concerns. While both panics have their roots in legitimate concerns, my perspective is not that of a realist � I am not primarily concerned with the extent of the purported harms. However, my research demonstrates that the legislation proposed (or passed) to curb these problems is an extraordinary response; it is misguided and in many cases masks the underlying problem. The first part of this paper discusses the cyberporn panic of the mid-1990s and its links to internet content legislation. Second, I outline a theory of technopanics, using the moral panics literature to examine fears of technology and modernity. The third section examines the current moral panic over social networking sites and MySpace.com in particular, including the DOPA legislation proposed to solve the problem. The fourth part of this paper takes a critical look at the harms of MySpace and online predators in general. I argue that in order to justify the passage of sweeping laws restricting all minors� access to MySpace, the problem of online predators using MySpace to elicit underage individuals for sexual activity has been portrayed as socially significant, which I do not believe to be the case. Rather, I believe that it is indicative of a small, visible number of sensationalized cases that have been used by the media to fuel a moral panic around the site. The idea of the �online predator� is further linked to real harms, such as child abuse and child pornography, to create rhetorical significance for legislative-based action. I conclude with some recommendations for legislators, parents, and journalists. Since moral panics are, by definition, public, any study of a moral panic must attempt to access popular discourse. This paper primarily uses Congressional testimony and popular press articles, both national and local, as evidence. Congressional testimony was found by conducting full-text searches of the Congressional Record, a publication which includes every word spoken on the floor of both the House and the Senate. Popular press articles were found through Lexis-Nexis, the websites of major and local newspapers, and television network and cable news programs.

<title> Towards a Data and Workflow Collaboratory for Research on Free and Open Source Software and its Development
<abstract> FLOSSmole is a collaborative data repository which collects and provides data for research on Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) and its development by online, distributed teams. The data is used by a research community that studies diverse questions from the evolution of software to how these groups make decisions, use various media and man- age change over time (Scacchi, 2007). This multi-disciplinary research community includes researchers both inside and outside iSchools, from many disciplines including software en- gineering, organizational studies, information systems and sociology, as well as corporate researchers. Since May 2007, we1 have been working to development this repository into an e-Social Sci- ence infrastructure capable of supporting, storing and publishing not only data but analyses organized into scienti c work ows, as envisioned in the NSF reports on Cyberinfrastruc- ture (Atkins, 2003; NSF Cyberinfrastructure Council, 2007). Further we are developing a pre-print repository which will enable bidirectional links between the data, work ows and published papers. The goal of the project is to facilitate collaboration to improve the re- producibility and consistency of research, collaboratively building a body of cumulative knowledge (Borgman, 2007; Finholt and Olson, 1997).

<title> Towards a Model of Determinants of Web Services Platform Adoption by Complementers
<abstract> The recent surge of interest in web services has called attention to the increasingly intense competition between owners of the platforms on which these services run. Given that widely adopted operating systems and middleware platforms have yielded sizable economic returns for their owners, many web services platform owners are aggressively pursuing strategies that can give them a competitive advantage and, it is hoped, similarly sizable returns. A review of the broader literature on software platform competition reveals widespread acceptance of network effect theory as an explanatory framework. Network effect theory posits that the value of a software platform to a potential user is associated positively with the number of existing users of the platform (who generate direct network effects) and the number of developers of complementary software applications (who generate indirect network effects) (see, e.g., Katz and Shapiro, 1986; Zhu et al., 2006). Users realize direct network effects when, for example, they share compatible files with other users (Gao and Iyer, 2006; Lin and Kulatilaka, 2006) or participate in �trading communities� (Zhu et al., 2006). Indirect network effects are realized through the availability of useful, innovative and compatible software applications (Lin and Kulatilaka, 2006). Users of widely adopted software platforms also gain value from the reduced likelihood of being �stranded with a failed and unsupported platform� and consequent switching costs (Gallaugher and Wang, 2002, p. 306). In the presence of network effects, then, software platform owners pursue strategies that will secure them an �installed base� of users and complementers that is sufficiently large to attract more and more new users (Shapiro and Varian, 1998; Suarez, 2005). While one set of strategies is aimed at promoting adoption by new users, another set emphasizes the value generated for users by indirect network effects and aims instead at promoting adoption by complementers. (This distinction reflects the idea that platform markets are two-sided, with (end) users populating one side and complementers populating the other.) There appears to be considerably more research on strategies for increasing user adoption (see Gallaugher and Wang (2002), von Westarp (2003) and Zhu and Iansiti (2007) for reviews) than on complementer adoption strategies. Nonetheless, three studies of the latter merit mentioning here. First, in their study of the U.S. video game industry from 1976 to 2002, Venkatraman and Lee (2003) find that platform dominance (i.e., largest installed base), together with complementers� path dependency and level of experience with platform architecture, largely determine platform adoption by complementers. Second, in his investigation of how software platform owners maintain a balance between �adoption and appropriation,� West (2003) concludes that software platform owners who disclose some proprietary code will attract more complements (thereby fostering innovation), but cautions against disclosing any code that confers a competitive advantage. Finally, Cusumano and Gawer�s (2002) landmark study of Intel�s platform management strategies culminated in the endorsement of four �levers� for platform leadership, with one of these levers aimed at managing relations with �external complementers�. Specific strategies include building a consensus on technical specifications and standards, handling potential conflicts of interest and letting complementers keep any intellectual property they develop on the platform. Both West (2003) and Cusumano and Gawer (2002) also underscore the importance of providing complementers with an interface to connect to the platform. Beyond West�s (2003, p. 1260) suggestion that software platform owners �create and evolve application programming interfaces (APIs),� though, the varied ways in which these APIs might influence a complementer�s choice to adopt have not been sufficiently explored by these or other authors. The research-in-progress described in the following section aims to bolster the somewhat scant literature on software platform adoption by complementers. More specifically, the proceeding research design outlines a proposed investigation of the determinants of complementer adoption of geo-mapping web services platforms. The reasons for including independent variables are discussed, and some methodological details are introduced. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of anticipated outcomes of the study.

<title> A Visual Map of Public Mementos and Conjectures
<abstract> How do we collectively feel about our future? Do we look forward to it with anxiety or vigor? Are we apprehensive or optimistic of what the future will bring? Since mood affects performance and well-being, the answers to these questions matter greatly to anyone concerned with public policy. The web is awash with material indicative of public mood, collective forecasting and personal relics. Several efforts have been undertaken to assess emotional status from online sources such as blogs, emails, web sites (Balog & De Rijke 2006) and search engine queries (see, for example, Google Trends). However, these efforts are limited, by the nature of their source material, to hindsight and near-present observations. The work presented here is concerned with collective speculations about the future. We present a visual analysis of publicly available textual content from futureme.org, a popular web service that allows its users to send themselves emails to be delivered at a later date, up to 30 years in the future. Many of these emails resemble "confessional" time capsules: their content is intended to project the user�s present emotional state at the origination date towards the indicated delivery date. These emails fall into two broad categories of content: a) conjectures about the future and b) mementos regarding the present or the past. By aggregating mood indicators extracted from messages directed to future dates, we can thus assess short and long term shifts in the collective emotional perception toward a particular point in the future. This principle is related to "wisdom of crowd" phenomena as observed in finance and prediction markets (Surowiecki 2004). Numerous psychometric instruments to assess individual mood states and monitor their fluctuations over time exist, the most prominent of which is the 65 item Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire (McNair, Loor, & Droppleman 1971). The 6 dimensional factor analytical structure of the POMS (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue and confusion) has been validated repeatedly (Norcross, Guadagnoli, & Prochaska 2006) and applied in hundreds of studies since its inception (McNair, Heuchert, & Shilony 2003). To make the POMS questionnaire applicable to the open-ended nature of email content, we extended the POMS set of 65 adjectives by nearly 793 synonyms using WordNet and Roget�s Thesaurus. We calculated the occurrences of extended POMS terms in the content of 30,000 publicly available "future" emails and mapped them to a normalized six-dimensional mood vector representing levels of tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue and confusion. These mood vectors were grouped according to the delivery date of the original email, resulting in a set of mood state vectors. Statistically significant mood changes were detected especially for depression and vigor indicators. The computation of mood levels was then implemented with a more specific textual analysis of the entire email corpus, aimed at identifying manifestations of conjectures and mementos. The results, presented in this poster, blend two different visual representation of the content analyzed: an "emotional timeline" - a cumulative depiction of mood levels between 2007 and 2036 - and a superimposed topic map of mementos and conjectures - an ontological model of commonly used terms and adjectives illustrating the chains of word association.

<title> Watching Organizational Opinion via Social Tagging
<abstract> Our collective understanding of the world around us is largely constructed upon what others think. We trust our neighbors more than strangers. We know things because we have either seen them ourselves or because we have it "on good information". On an individual level, the process of keeping track of what your neighbors' opinions are has largely been a cognitive exercise. Few of us took the time to document the opinions of our peers and acquaintances - much less analyze that documentation for patterns or correlations. With the advent of social tagging, this collective opinion can be inexpensively visualized and reflected upon, counted and analyzed. Tagging data can be viewed as a marker for the pulse of an organization. With the proper visualizations and training, social tagging could become the most powerful information organization and management tool available. The tagging triumvirate consists of the person doing the tagging, the term being applied, and the object being tagged. What is usually forgotten is the fact that the tagging event happens at a certain time. Tracking how the tagging practices of an organization or group change over time can deliver valuable insight into what the organization is doing and thinking. If the object being tagged is explicitly restricted to someone's performance or expertise, a very interesting dataset could be collected quickly. What a group thinks someone is good at, while subjective, could be counted. Perhaps more interesting is the potential for seeing the time-lapsed tagging behavior around a collection of people's expertise. Entire groups of talent could be analyzed as a whole with careful consideration given to the points in time where learning and understanding were apparently happening. Building on earlier work from Cloudalicio.us, this visualization technique could afford an organization new insight into how it understands its own membership.

<title> Why leave Wikipedia?
<abstract> Some user-contributed content (UCC) applications, such as Yahoo!Answers,Wikipedia, and YouTube have drawn much media attention. Various reasons motivate the tremendous contributions to a few UCC systems so far. Existing literature has uncovered many factors that affect users� decisions to become contributors [Bryant et al., 2005], to continue contributing [Nov, 2007], and to increase contribution [Chen et al., 2007], but none of them pay attention to why active contributors decide to stop contributing. The exit of active contributors may affect quantity and quality of content provision on UCC systems. Indeed, preliminary evidence shows that there is a reason to worry about the long term sustainability of some systems. In 2000, Adar and Huberman�s study on the Gnutella network showed that there was high level of free-riding on this network. Five years later, Hughes et al. [2005] find on the same network free-riding has gotten worse: the percentage of users who do not share any files has increased from 66 % to 85%. In the mean time, Andrew Lih, one active Wikipedia research/contributor also blogged about its growth rate slowing down dramatically in late 2006 [Lih, 2007]. To what extent is this due to contributors leaving the system? If so, who left? And for what reasons? Answers to these questions are useful to UCC system designers for determining the impact of contributors leaving or for devising mechanisms to prevent them from leaving. In this study we focus on one system, Wikipedia, and analyze why some editors stop contributing. We chose Wikipedia for a number of reasons. First, it has a large number of active contributors. By mid-2006 over 10,000 editors had made more than 100 edits [Kittur et al., 2007]. Second, Wikipedia maintains a detailed record of its contributors� activities, and shares its database online.

<title> Author Meets Critics: Sandra Braman
<abstract> The publication of Sandra Braman�s Change of State signals the importance of the topic of information policy to the field of information studies. It also illustrates both the power and necessity of the kind of inter-disciplinary analysis that characterizes the field. This panel will provide an opportunity for both structured debate and lively discussion around Change of State and the important arguments it contains. Perhaps the most important one that it makes is that �trends in information policy both manifest and trigger change in the nature of governance itself.� That is, Braman points to how information flows have radically altered the nature of the traditional nation-state and its ability to exercise power (or fails to, as the case may be). Because of i-Schools� strong connections with the professional world of information institutions, it is particularly important for graduates to understand the far-reaching implications of this argument. On a practical level, graduates need to become conversant with both the varied manifestations of information policy, and the mechanisms by which such policy is enacted. Change of State provides a highly useful synthesis of all the major debates in the field of information policy (including identity, immigration, innovation policy, etc.), organizing them into a comprehensive analytical framework, along with extensive bibliographic essays. The format of this session will involve each speaker presenting a 15 minute paper which will discuss Change of State from their own disciplinary perspective. Prof. Braman will then respond to the papers. The presentations will be followed by a question and answer period with the audience. The goal is to offer both structured debate around key arguments presented in the book, while offering an opportunity for the audience to interact with the speakers. The speakers are all leaders in the field, well-informed of Dr. Braman�s work, and chosen with the goal of maximizing disciplinary perspectives (Lievrouw: communication policy; Mueller: political science; Jackson: science and technology studies).

<title> Bridging Discourses: Exploring the Relationship between Information Technologies and International Development
<abstract> The panel will bring together scholars of information with training in computer science, economics, cultural studies, and the interdisciplinary social sciences to explicitly probe into the relationships held between information and technology initiatives and international development studies. The scholars presenting are leading voices conducting global applied research that concurrently consider social, cultural, economic, and technological factors. We believe that this interdisciplinary set of short presentations can stimulate an important dialogue related to the emergent relationships held between information and the over 70% of the world that still lacks routinized access to digital technologies and the internet.

<title> Can I-Schools Fulfill Their Mission Without Archival Studies?
<abstract> If one listens in the library and archives communities to the whispers and rumors about the I-School movement, the sense one has about what is going on is that this is just another effort to move away from the traditional library school, merely another phase in the natural evolution of a portion of these schools into something far different than what the library science pioneers ever envisioned. Before the I-School movement was here, however, other aspects of these historic schools were evolving, such as can be seen in the history of graduate archival education having a place in the library and later library and information science programs. However, in this session we take a somewhat different tack, arguing that older areas of studies such as archival studies are essential to the future of I-Schools, particularly as these schools tackle the increasingly complex issues confronting a digital society. This session will consist of a preliminary paper co-written by leaders in archival studies and the concept of I-Schools (Richard J. Cox and Ron Larsen respectively) with two different commentators on the Cox-Larsen presentation who bring different perspectives to this topic. The paper will discuss the mission and history of I-Schools, the mission and history of archival studies, the basic elements and concepts of archival studies which are critical to I-Schools (curation and preservation of primary and secondary sources that are born-digital, the life cycle/continuum concept of records, the preservation imperative, cultural and humanistic perspectives, public and institutional memory, and the evolving notion of records in the digital era), and matters of the changing nature of personal and institutional archives which may be best fit into an I-School curriculum and mission (e.g., the implications of new portable digital technologies on issues such as the creation, maintenance, and use of records and information sources deemed to possess long-term archival value).

<title> CHI, ICIS, SIGIR and Numerous Other Outlets That Won�t Accept My Work: The Perils of Publishing Multidisciplinary Research?
<abstract> The motivation for this session comes directly from two series of comments made at the 2007 iConference. The first was uttered at a pre-conference workshop. In a discussion on where to publish, the recommendation was made to aim for the outlet First Monday. Now First Monday is a fine online journal, but it is certainly not on any institution�s A-list that I know of. If First Monday is your lead journal, what�s your fall back? The second comment was made at a session on digital library research, where the panelists were asked what they considered their major publication outlets. The overwhelming answer was the SIGIR Conference. Now SIGIR is fine conference, but when one thinks of openness to new ideas, SIGIR is not the first conference that jumps to mind. These comments, and many others made in informal discussions, raise the concerns of disseminating multidisciplinary research results. This interactive session will address the subject of publishing multidisciplinary research.

<title> How Public Is the Internet? A Conversation on the Nature of Human Interactions On-line and the Implications for Research Methods
<abstract> In the past decade, �virtual� research�empirical investigations conducted via the Internet�has increased dramatically across a variety of disparate disciplines. Areas such as cybersecurity and encryption, digital government and citizenship, consumer health informatics, and user behavior in online spaces have emerged to become signature iSchool research areas, often shared with particular disciplinary heritages (e.g., computer science, political science and communication, public health, and sociology�respectively, but not exclusively). In addition, the field of Information Science is dominated by research developing or using emerging technologies. These new technologies often occupy a gray area in which ethical issues either have not been sufficiently well-defined or push against existing definitions. Questions surrounding the �public� nature of the internet and Web 2.0-era information technologies have also emerged and have become increasingly urgent given the tightening of federal, state and University regulations as they relate to the protection of human subjects. At the convergence of multiple disciplinary and methodological perspectives, Information Science researchers are well-positioned to become more active participants in both scholarly and institutional conversations regarding the appropriate risks and benefits that participants in online research studies might be subject to. Critiques of IRB inconsistencies exist, what we need is a thoughtful and thorough community response to the innately complex nature of virtual research and a map which can guide us towards the future and the study of twenty-first century systems, selves and societies. Our goal for this wildcard event, is to generate a lively and rigorous debate which accomplishes the following three goals: 1) extends the dialogue within the Information Science field concerning the beneficence and respect for participants in online research; 2) enumerates a set of best practices for iSchool researchers in relation to conducting approved research on-line and; 3) moves us towards the process of drafting an iSchool set of ethical guidelines related to virtual research.

<title> Info-scavengers
<abstract> Scavenger hunts are emergent collections, constructed out of small bits of information gathered by the players. As information scholars, we engage in scavenger hunts every day, whether researching ideas to formulate a paper, looking for the right regex pattern to parse a chunk of data, or integrating information into the correct ontology for a set of documents. We hope to illuminate this process in our everyday lives as students by revisiting the scavenger hunt for the world of us, the informavors [3]. We propose a scavenger hunt that takes place in and around the UCLA library. We intend to base some of the structure of the event on Jane McGonigal's work on Big Games [2]. Participants will engage the physical environment of UCLA campus in the access of information. Groups of 4 members will be given a set of 15 clues about different types of information that exist in a multiple spatiotemporal locations. In order to unlock their clues, groups will forage [4] and retrieve information using social and theoretical processes studied in the field. Information will include literary objects in the library, files "buried" in the web, and actual physical objects around the UCLA campus. In following with the berrypicking model of information retrieval [1], some clues will point to other clues, helping participants refine their search. Such clues interact with each other and need to be decoded in a certain order; however, all 15 clues will be given out at the same time. Groups will have 1 hour to gather all 15 clues, assemble them into the right order and unlock a final clue to win the game. As a technical requirement, teams will need access to UCLAs wireless network so they have access to the world wide web, where some of the clues will be located. Each team should have at least one laptop between them.

<title> Is There a Cloud in your Future? Applications of �Cloud Computing� to Web-scale Problems
<abstract> Is there a cloud in your future? Applications of �cloud computing� to Web-scale problems Proposal for a �wildcard� session, iConference 2008 Organizer: Jimmy Lin (jimmylin@umd.edu) Assistant Professor College of Information Studies University of Maryland, College Park 1. Background IBM and Google recently committed a total of $30 million over two years to an initiative on �cloud computing�, in collaboration with six universities across the country (see references). They are: Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Stanford, the University of Maryland, and the University of Washington. I am the leader of this initiative at the University of Maryland, and to my knowledge the only participant from an iSchool (the rest are lead by faculty in computer science departments). �Cloud computing� refers to technology for exploiting large computer clusters to tackle �Web-scale� information processing problems, where immense quantities of data make traditional sequential processing impractical. Specifically, this initiative focuses on Google�s MapReduce programming paradigm, which was specifically designed for processing extremely large data sets (and indeed used by Google itself for much of its production operations). Programs written in the MapReduce functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program�s execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication. Hadoop is an open-source implementation of the MapReduce framework. As a part of this initiative, IBM and Google are making Hadoop clusters available to the university collaborators, with the simultaneous goal of advancing research and education. For the past two months, the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab at the University of Maryland has been actively exploiting this resource for research in natural language processing and information retrieval. The exponential explosion of information on the Web and in easily accessible digital formats forces us to think �outside the box� when tackling data-intensive �Web-scale� problems. Researchers must think and analyze data at a massively parallel scale or face the prospect of being relegated to work on �toy� problems. �Cloud computing� could potentially provide the infrastructure that allows researchers to tackle �Web-scale� challenges at a reasonable cost. From an educational point of view, the ability to think about problems in terms of parallel processing algorithms will become a critical skill in tomorrow�s work force. �Cloud computing� is an emerging technology that iSchools cannot afford to ignore. 2. Goals � To introduce the iSchool community to �cloud computing� and the MapReduce framework � To provide the iSchool community an overview of research and education efforts currently underway � To begin a discussion on the implications of �cloud computing� to research and education in iSchools

<title> iSchool Proposal for Themed Wildcard Session on New Information Systems Methods
<abstract> �New Information Systems� is an emerging field composed of social studies of science (STS), information sciences (IS), workplace studies and technological design, and new media forms such as cyberinfrastructure or eResearch. Within this area we are exploring the connections and inter-relationships between empirical studies of information at knowledge creation and use, and methods from more traditional IS, social networks, grounded theory and ethnomethodology. The collective creation of a theoretically driven cluster at this juncture would tie us together in a convergence that would link our scholarship and enable students to access this strong and existing - yet invisible - college. We propose a �wildcard� session here that makes a space for people to speak about their methods, assess their viability for helping to build our emerging community, and hopefully to explore the �behind the scenes� actions associated with practicing any methods. Such an event is most timely. At the recent meetings of the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S), an entire day was devoted to the emerging intersections of STS and IS. In addition it should be noted that the same book, Memory Practices in the Sciences (G. Bowker, MIT Press, 2007), won the best book award at both ASIST and 4S. This might be seen as a harbinger for the deeply theoretical and methodological work that is to take place, if the intersection is to be a robust one. Our research directions will be focused on studies of infrastructure, ethical actions that are inscribed into IS, and theoretical studies of questions such as �what is useful information�? We need to unpack the contextual nature of knowledge creation and use. As well, we need to understand the ways in which it is entangled with obligations from different domains and communities of practice such as privacy, consent, anonymity, confidentiality, ownership and a whole host of organizational and professional matters. New media studies point to an intense overlapping and interrelationship of fields and disciplines. Methods should come from a combination of (1) sensitivity to the historical moment (e.g., multiculturalism, extreme changes in the meaning of �global�); (2) an assemblage of tools that are ready to hand, theoretically driven, are pleasant and effective to use; and (3) embody an ethical commitment to the values and meanings of those who are being studied (emic), within a way to explore the conventions, standards and infrastructures that both constrain and enable their experiences (etic). The papers here aim to show a range of approaches from the current STS, IS and Workplace Studies emergence that speak to the criteria detailed above. Each participant in the experiemntal forum will bring an example of their research, and as honestly as possible, assess its methodological strengths and weaknesses. The assessment will be relative to strengthening the development of the iSchool community, to the intersections noted above, and to the welfare of respondents.

<title> iSchools and Undergraduate Education
<abstract> Undergraduate education is an important component of many i-Schools and of potential interest to many others. The nature of undergraduate education within the i-School movement will, no doubt, have a significant effect on our collective future. Undergraduate programs are often the most visible programs to other departments within the Universities in which we reside. They help shape first impressions of many current and prospective students. And, they force us to synthesize our various interests into a more basic core. While all i-Schools have significant graduate programs, i-Schools vary widely in their stance toward undergraduate education. Some offer a full Bachelor Degree program, others offer a minor, and still others teach a single course at most. What�s more, the undergraduate courses and curriculum vary widely across schools. This diversity is likely a natural outgrowth of historical processes unique to each University and is unlikely to disappear. Indeed, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with i-School undergraduate education. However, despite our different needs, there are some fundamental issues that all i-School undergraduate programs must grapple with: the interdisciplinary nature of i-School education, the shared domain knowledge, and the need to explain our relatively new curriculum and programs to the wider University, students, and employers. This session is designed to start a conversation about these (and other) commonly shared issues and provide a platform for us to learn from one another�s experience. It is most likely to benefit faculty members and administrators involved with undergraduate education in their schools. It is also intended to be useful for schools considering expanding their undergraduate program.

<title> iSchools in Central and South Europe: Developments and Challenges of Cooperation
<abstract> The countries of Central and South Europe entered the 2000s with plans to restructure their higher education systems based on Bologna recommendations and some other EU supported guidelines. The Humboldt tradition at the universities in the region, necessity to introduce new academic profiles as well as the use of ICT in higher education, is leading the way towards the restructuring of existing programs or designing new curricula and to cooperation between the LIS and IS departments in the region. This panel will address the special concerns for restructuring curricula in the wider information sciences field (Library and Information Science - LIS, Information Science � IS, Records Management � RM, education for digital services etc) Panelists will address three questions with respect to i-schools developments and trends in their respective countries: � What are the basic concerns in developing new curricula in their respective countries? � How do the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary issues influence curricula design in IS? � What are the future steps, particularly in regard to regional cooperation? After each of the panelists will have presented his position concerning these three questions, they will discuss especially the issues on inter-/multidisciplinarity and on future regional cooperation. The audience of the panel discussion is invited to join this discussion.

<title> Let�s get Wild: Building a National Research and Service Agenda for Community Technologies and Networking
<abstract> Community technology programs often lack the funding and technical assistance needed to sustain successful programs, let alone improve and expand their services. In the United States, these programs are training low-income youth, getting GEDs and technology skills to high school dropouts, upgrading the skills of recent immigrants, and working with a host of other residents to bring them towards success in the 21st century. Internationally, community technology programs are often the first step in empowering individuals and communities to move toward fuller participation in a global society. However, ensuring digital inclusion requires effective policy and sufficient investment, and good research to determine impact and provide the necessary underpinnings for policy and investment decisions. We are proposing a wildcard submission under the conference theme of �Community Technologies and Networking (CTN),� with participants from eight institutions heavily involved in CTN. Our wildcard session will comprise a 90 minute forum in which faculty and doctoral students�with varied academic and professional backgrounds�share their involvement, challenges and dreams for making a difference through CTN in different settings. The anticipated outcome of this session will be a clear picture of the landscape for research programs moving forward, and a better understanding of the breadth and depth of work already being done or planned in this area across the iSchool community. Building on the successful preconference community informatics workshop at the 2006 iSchool Conference at the University of Michigan, our wildcard session will be synergistic with the upcoming 2009 �Communities and Technology� Conference being held at Penn State. The wildcard session will provide an opportunity for the CTN community to meet and discuss multi-level issues with an aim of charting a unified path toward meaningful outcomes.

<title> Mapping the Design Space of Design Education in iSchools
<abstract> iSchools have a well-established reputation for rigorous analysis, applying a range of multidisciplinary methods. However, increasingly many of us are teaching design elements as well as doing design in our research. We believe that as iSchools, we have a unique perspective, or accent, on design activities, which comes from our history of studying not just the design of information systems and how people use them, but from taking a step back and studying the information behavior of individuals and groups, thus taking a more holistic view of design. It is time for iSchools to assert their accent more explicitly in the study of design by integrating design perspectives across multiple disciplines. The development of new multidisciplinary design schools, such as the Stanford Design School, and RPI's Product Design & Innovation program, highlight the value of an iSchool-like, multidisciplinary approach to understanding design. However, iSchools� accent is more than just a multidisciplinary approach; it can bring a critical perspective on multidisciplinary design that can also question the function of design as an information practice. iSchools can account for ethical, social, and more systematic concerns, along with an accent on the more overlapping cognitive and information aesthetic aspects of design practice. However, while this new accent on design is present in iSchools, it is currently underarticulated. With the recent growth of computer applications that can be tailored and combined without requiring sophisticated programming skills, and with the greater accessibility to tools for technology production, design is becoming an increasingly essential skill in the modern organization. Students need to learn design skills and "design-thinking" in order to secure desirable jobs post-graduation [2]. What are we, as iSchools, doing to prepare students for this emerging market? How are we teaching design, design practice, and design thinking? In art and architecture programs, students take design studios where they learn design methods and engage in long-term design projects. However, in iSchools and Computer Science programs students are typically given little explicit design instruction, and are often forced to discover on their own how to think about and do design as they engage in projects for class and work. We are proposing this Wildcard to enable a conversation about design from an iSchool perspective. We aim to focus on the special case of design instruction. The proposal authors have experience teaching design at different levels (undergraduate, masters, and doctoral) to multidisciplinary audiences, with students not just from more systems-construction-oriented disciplines such as CS, Library and Information Science (LIS), Urban Planning, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Geographic Information Systems; but also from disciplines as disparate as English, History, Media Studies, International Studies, Journalism, Cognitive Science, and various disciplines within Education (Curriculum and Instruction, Secondary and Continuing Education, Educational Psychology, and Human Resource Education) [1, 3]. For many of our students, however, thinking in design terms is an alien concept. Thus, we see this Wildcard as having the secondary goal of helping us all to understand the design space of teaching design to students with diverse backgrounds. The aim of this Wildcard is to consider a particular design space that of teaching design in an iSchool. We aim to chart our collective experiences and intentions in teaching to help understand the challenges of conflicting goals, various opportunities and multiply-scaled constraints that characterize this particular design space.

<title> Narratives of Engagement: Working at the Intersections of Information, Social, and Domain Science
<abstract> Engagement � sometimes called action research, contribution, or intervention � is the participation of the researcher in the object of study. It is a key contemporary feature in making iSchool research accessible and relevant to broader communities. However, it also presents novel challenges for the traditional academic endeavor. We have many �shorthands� for these difficulties: misaligned reward structures, diverging goals, miscommunication across heterogeneous expertises, multiple membership, challenges of multidisciplinary collaboration, or unrealistic expectations on social science. Often these difficulties are precisely what our research attempts to address but only rarely do we give ourselves leeway to discuss how they affect our own practice. We have arranged this session to open and encourage discourse on the experiences, approaches and outcomes of engagement. The core of the presentations will be centered on storytelling. Stories, or narratives, are ideal devices for capturing and conveying the complexities of real world field experiences. The four participants in this interactive panel will recount exemplary narratives of their engagement at the intersections of social research, information studies and domain sciences. These stories will serve as the material for an open discussion. Our participants were selected both for their diverse modes of interface with their objects of study and a shared commitment to engaging social /information/domain science. This includes a range of activities stretching from policy recommendations, to participant observation or contributions to technology design; from distanced roles such as �shrink wrapped� consulting, to long view historical studies, to becoming a daily members and �stakeholders� in the success of projects.

<title> Okay, Facebook me: Exploring behavior, motivations and uses in Social Network Sites
<abstract> In the information sciences, there is significant interest in the study of social network websites. Sites such as Myspace and Facebook have drawn hundreds of millions of users, shaping and contextualizing new forms of social information transfer. Furthermore, the impact of social networking sites on the college campuses we inhabit is substantial; students use social network sites to connect, engage with fellow students, and to form new learning opportunities. In this wildcard session, four (with a potential fifth) researchers exploring social network sites will come together to debate and examine the future of social network scholarship. The panelists bring a significant breadth of experience, varying research questions, and a broad scope of methodological approaches. Rather than simply presenting research and fielding questions, the panelists will engage in a debate exploring some critical and exploratory aspects of social network sites. What do social network site behaviors represent? How are we constructing new publics in social network sites? What is the future of social networking? With this high interactivity format, this session will provide significant insight into social network sites. Scheduled to participate in the session are danah boyd, Ph.D. student at UC-Berkeley�s Chool of Information, Cliff Lampe, Assistant Professor in the department of Telecommunications, Information Studies and Media at Michigan State University, Alice Marwick, PhD student at New York University in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication, and Fred Stutzman, Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Information and Library Science.

<title> Research Perspectives on Social Tagging
<abstract> Social tagging has emerged as one of the most popular social software tools available online. Originating from Del.icio.us, social tagging capabilities can now be found on a number of major music, news, video, and commercial websites, as well as on social network sites and enterprise systems. Although social tagging allows individuals to organize content utilizing user-generated vocabulary, the power of social tagging stems from the ability to view and share resources with other users of the system. Through the sharing of tags and resources, social tagging systems facilitate network connections and perhaps even the creation of communities. In this panel, an exciting group of young researchers will present their ongoing work on social tagging. This panel will present a variety of perspectives on social tagging ranging from qualitative ethnographic work to quantitative visualizations. Additionally, the panel will cover topics such as: the definition of a tag, the role that tags play in social network sites, as well as tags in corporate and organizational settings. The research and the varying methods presented in this panel will present viewers with an exciting array of perspectives on social tagging. Additionally, in order to further engage the audience, the panelists will also participate in a point-counterpoint discussion with the participants which will help illuminate both the advantages and disadvantages of social tagging, as well as further highlight the multiple perspectives and approaches available for continuing social tagging research.

<title> What to Do with Geeks and Nerds? A Collaborative Website Analysis Workshop
<abstract> Social scientists no longer have to travel far and wide for data on social life, as it is now available at our fingertips on the web. However, many of the techniques normally used in traditional research such as participant-observation and the writing of field notes, need to be adapted quite a bit for use in this new media. Rather than data being expensive and precious, the dilemma becomes how to choose from so much information and how to store and analyze it in meaningful ways that remain acceptable within more traditional fields of study. In this interactive workshop, we will start by introducing our previous work on IT occupational culture, the stereotypes of geeks and nerds, and the potential implications of these stereotypes in the recruiting of people to information technology careers. Taking the topic of geeks and nerds in the IT culture as the topic for our web research, we will describe our experiences on conducting web research by archiving websites using the Mozilla Firefox scrapbook Add-on tool. We will talk about the tool and its features and briefly provide examples of previous research explorations. Then, we will present examples of our research journey on our topic using the scrapbook tool collecting and analyzing data from several websites (commercial sites, blogs, videos) as an experiment to see what we can learn about the culture of geeks and nerds by viewing different types of websites. Finally, as the heart of the workshop, we will have a collective activity of brainstorming, applying, and comparing techniques for webpage analysis, using the topic of geeks and nerds in the IT culture as subject material for discussion. We plan to form multidisciplinary groups from the audience and facilitate a half-hour break-out session to allow the smaller groups to share ideas and summarize their initial findings. The groups will then reunite for a large-group exchange about archiving and analysis of websites about a certain theme. The organizers of this workshop embody a multi-disciplinary approach in all of our work and look forward to the opportunity to forge diverse groups to help analyze the websites from different perspectives and inspire new thinking about possible methods for website analysis.
