<title> Demographic and Maslow’s Motivation Predictors of Job Satisfaction of Information Technology Artisans in Nigeria
<keywords> information technology, artisans, Job satisfaction, Maslow, Nigeria 
<topics> information technology and work
<abstract> A new artisanship crop moored to information technology has emerged, and it is being heavily embraced in Nigeria. Guided by Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, this study examined job satisfaction among the information technology artisans in Nigeria. Job satisfaction was measured by whether the artisans wish to stay on the job, perceive their income as high or low, or consider the profession as having a good prospect; and on a binary scale of yes or no. The study also investigated how the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents relate to their needs. Data was collected from 950 artisans randomly selected from two major locations in Nigeria with the aid of a questionnaire and an interview schedule. A breakdown of the Maslow’s variables predicted different job satisfaction differently just as the demographic and social characteristics of the respondents predicted the artisans’ needs differently.

<title> Israeli Parties and Party Leaders on Facebook during the 2013 Election Campaign
<keywords> elections, social network sties, political fandom
<topics> communication studies, qualitative research methods, social media
<abstract> During the 2013 elections in Israel one of the major methods of interaction of the political parties and their leaders with potential voters was through their Facebook pages. These pages were followed for 50 days preceding the elections. For each page, 30% of the posts on the page were analyzed in terms of their rhetoric and subject. The largest number of the analyzed posts was intended for bonding with the audience, and unsurprisingly politics was the most frequent topic. The findings show that personal posts received the largest number of likes pointing to the personal nature of the elections. Findings were compared with results of analysis of the Facebook pages of the US Presidential candidates. Similarities were found, even though in Israel there is a party system and elections are not personal.

<title> “That's Not An Architecture Problem!”: Techniques and Challenges for Practicing Anticipatory Technology Ethics
<keywords> technology ethics, values in design
<topics> information/computing ethics
<abstract> Anticipatory technology ethics is the practice of analyzing how emerging technologies will be built, imagining how they might be used, and interpreting what their consequences might be. Information researchers and professionals are increasingly interested in understanding the possible social impacts of technologies before wide-spread deployment, and anticipatory technology ethics provides one lens through which to do so. This paper reports on two anticipatory ethics projects. These contrasting projects tested techniques for practicing anticipatory ethics, and also illuminated challenges that stem from diverse engineering work practices and the design of user-facing versus infrastructural technologies. In particular, the paper focuses on the problem of at what layer ethical issues can be found in technology design, and the ways that the material realities of design impact developers’ willingness and readiness to participate in anticipatory ethics.

<title> Tagging vs. Controlled Vocabulary: Which is More Helpful for Book Search?
<keywords> social tagging, controlled vocabulary, book search, information retrieval
<topics> information organization and metadata, information seeking/retrieval, quantitative analyses including statistics
<abstract> The popularity of social tagging has sparked a great deal of debate on whether tags could replace or improve upon professional metadata as descriptors of books and other information objects. In this paper we present a large-scale empirical comparison of the contributions of individual information elements like core bibliographic data, controlled vocabulary terms, reviews, and tags to the retrieval performance. Our comparison is done using a test collection of over 2 million book records with information elements from Amazon, the British Library, the Library of Congress, and LibraryThing. We find that tags and controlled vocabulary terms do not actually outperform each other consistently, but seem to provide complementary contributions: some information needs are best addressed using controlled vocabulary terms whereas other are best addressed using tags.

<title> Appropriating Digital Fabrication Technologies – A comparative study of two 3D Printing Communities
<keywords> Appropriation; infrastructuring; empirical study; user-centered design; 3D printing; hardware-related context
<topics> qualitative research methods, knowledge management
<abstract> Digital fabrication technologies have a great potential for empowering consumers to produce their own creations. However, despite the growing availability of digital fabrication technologies in shared machine shops such as FabLabs or University Labs, they are often perceived as difficult to use, especially by users with limited technological aptitude. Hence, it is not yet clear if the potentials of the technology can be made accessible to a broader public, or if they will remain limited to some form of “maker elite”. In this paper, we study the appropriation of digital fabrication on the example of the use of 3D printers in two different communities. In doing so, we analyze how users conceptualize their use of the 3D printers, what kind of contextual understanding is necessary to work with the machines, and how users document and share their knowledge. Based on our empirical findings, we identify the potentials that the machines offer to the communities, and what kind of challenges have to be overcome in their appropriation of the technology.

<topics> communication studies, history, theory and philosophy of information, qualitative research methods
<abstract> Public libraries have been associated with a Habermasian public sphere, but articulations between public libraries and the public sphere remain undefined. To make fuller sense of the public sphere as it relates to public libraries, we used qualitative content analysis as a research methodology to study 12 Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh annual reports from 1900 to 2010. We identified 6 dimensions of the public sphere in public libraries: Core Criteria, Internal Public Sphere, External Public Sphere, Collect and Organize Discourse, Perform Legitimation Processes, and Facilitate Discourse. Using the dimensions we found, we developed a model to explain how public libraries function as instruments of the public sphere.

<keywords> anonymity, digital media, disclosure, self-presentation, reddit
<topics> qualitative research methods, social computing, online communities
<abstract> Social media websites and web forums increasingly resemble massive media-sharing spaces where participants must manage self-presentation by targeting data disclosures to anticipated audiences. To explore the dynamics of selective disclosure, we conducted a qualitative study with participants on the social news site, reddit, and examined how people discuss its content in conversation on the website, in other websites, and in face-to-face conversation. We conducted 24 interviews with users and analyzed a supplementary corpus of popular reddit threads and reddit Internet Relay Chat logs. We also made regular use of the website to ground our understanding of the community. In our inductive analysis we found that many reddit users described deliberate social choices to compartmentalize discussions involving content on the website from their social lives beyond.

<title> Learning Strategies in Smart Grid Adoption: An Explorative Study in the U.S. Electric Utility Industry
<keywords> smart grid, organizational learning, IT knowledge challenge
<topics> information systems, knowledge management
<abstract> The U.S. electric utility industry is facing a number of challenges today. In response, utilities are investing in smart grid technologies to mitigate them. Yet, smart grid adoption presents significant knowledge barriers to utilities. This study aims to advance the understanding of IT knowledge challenges in smart grid adoption by focusing on three research questions: 1) what knowledge requirements are critical for smart grid adoption and what knowledge gaps are faced by utilities 2) are utilities responding to these knowledge gaps; and 3) What factors help explain differences in utilities’ responses. Due to the unique nature of the electric utility industry, we take a qualitative, exploratory approach to address these questions. Our analysis reveals five types of knowledge essential in smart grid adoption and uncovers utilities’ responses to these challenges based on an internal vs. external learning framework. Our study also suggests that utilities’ responses depend on a mix of knowledge and organizational factors.

<title> On the Margins of the Machine: Heteromation and Robotics
<keywords> social robots, heteromation, labor, political economy
<topics> social informatics, human-computer interaction, information technology and work
<abstract> Growing interest in robotics in policy and professional circles promises a future where machines will perform many of the social and institutional functions that have traditionally belonged to human beings. This promise is based on the unexamined premise that robots can act autonomously, without much support from their human users. Close examination of current social robots, however, introduces a different image, where human labor is critically needed for any meaningful operation of these systems. Such labor is normally unacknowledged and made invisible in media and academic portrayals of robotic systems. We take issue with this erasure, and seek to bring human labor to the fore. Drawing on the concept of “heteromation,” we illustrate the indispensible role of human labor in the functioning of many of the existing technological systems. Given current uncertainties in the robotic design space, we explore various scenarios for the future development of these systems, and the different ways by which they might unfold.

<title> Affective Signals as Implicit Indicators of Information Relevancy and Information Processing Strategies
<keywords> Information Retrieval, Information Processing Strategies, Affective Signals
<topics> human information behavior, information seeking/retrieval, human-computer interaction
<abstract> Search engines have become better in providing information to users, however, they still face major challenges such as determining how searchers process information, how they make relevance judgments, and how their cognitive or emotional state affect their search progress. We address these challenges by exploring searchers' affective dimension. In particular, we investigate how feelings, facial expressions, and electrodermal activity (EDA) could help to understand information relevancy, search progress, and information processing strategies (IPSs). To meet this goal, we designed an experiment with 45 participants exposed to affective stimuli prior solving a precision-oriented search task. Results indicate that initial affective states are linked to IPSs. In addition, we found that smiles act as implicit indicators of information relevancy and IPSs. Moreover, results convey that both smiles and EDA may serve as implicit indicators of progress and completion of search tasks. Findings from this work have practical implications in areas such as personalization and relevance feedback.

<title> CITREC: An Evaluation Framework for Citation-Based Similarity Measures based on TREC Genomics and PubMed Central
<keywords> Test Collection, Benchmark, Similarity Measure, Citation, Reference, TREC, PMC
<topics> data analytics and evaluation, recommender systems, information seeking/retrieval
<abstract> Citation-based similarity measures such as Bibliographic Coupling and Co-Citation are an integral component of many information retrieval systems. However, comparisons of the strengths and weaknesses of measures are challenging due to the lack of suitable test collections. This paper presents CITREC, an open evaluation framework for citation-based and text-based similarity measures. CITREC prepares the data from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset and the TREC Genomics collection for a citation-based analysis and provides tools necessary for performing evaluations of similarity measures. To account for different evaluation purposes, CITREC implements 35 citation-based and text-based similarity measures, and features two gold standards. The first gold standard uses the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus and the second uses the expert relevance feedback that is part of the TREC Genomics collection to gauge similarity. CITREC additionally offers a system that allows creating user defined gold standards to adapt the evaluation framework to individual information needs and evaluation purposes.

<title> Towards Open Data for Political Accountability: Examining the US and UK models
<keywords> open government, open data, accountability
<topics> information policy and open access
<abstract> Since 2009 governments worldwide have been developing Open Government Data (OGD) programs. Our paper examines the ways in which public agencies in the two leading OGD countries, the US and the UK, have released information assets to promote public sector accountability. Theoretically and empirically, we discuss the vision and execution of the OGD policy in these countries since 2009 and demonstrate that the movement took a different path than the one chartered by the original policy makers. We then propose a new path for the OGD movement to better support the democratic ideal of improved accountability of public sector agencies.

<title> Exploring the Use of Personas in User-Centered Design of Web-based e-services
<keywords> Persona, User-Centered Design, Web-based e-service, Case Study, Qualitative Research
<topics> qualitative research methods, human-computer interaction, information systems
<abstract> Web-based e-services are often developed for diverse user populations. This is a challenge to the design as the e-service then has to meet different user goals and needs. User-centered design have been suggested as a feasible approach to develop artifacts that meet needs and goals of several user groups by involving actual users in the design. However, developing web-based e-services for diverse user populations requires involvement of actual end users whom the designer seldom has access to or control over. In this paper we explore the function that documented personas, as stand-in to real users, can bring to the design of web-based e-services. Actual use of persona observed in a commercial design project is compared with persona benefits derived from UCD theory, evaluating their usefulness in design of web e-services. In addition ten supplementary benefits are derived from the data and discussed in terms of value to the design of web-based e-services.

<title> Information and learning activities in organisations: participants’ views on where and how to engage
<keywords> social, informal, formal, information behaviour, learning
<topics> human information behavior
<abstract> The purpose of this paper is to explore how people’s views on where and how to engage in social interaction relate to how they interact. More specifically, the purpose is to examine how these views, based on negotiated social values and norms, may explain the nature of relationships. This paper is based on a qualitative study in the form of interviews at the Land Warfare Centre (LWC), a part of the Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF). The results show that interaction and learning in the studied setting are characterised by 1) local and oral learning, 2) bypassing formal processes and 3) treasuring colleagues. The conducted research provides empirical findings that show that people’s views clearly relate to how they interact and to how they construct relationships and learning within them. Thus, in order to take steps to facilitate learning in organisations, it is important to understand these dynamics.

<topics> data science including digital curation and big data, information services, information systems
<abstract> Mobile applications (m-apps), which are based upon open urban data, make up new ways of governmental services and information. In a large-scale study we analyzed 471 m-apps of 24 metropolitan regions all over the world, regarding their implementation and usage development. For instance cities like Sydney, New York or Berlin host so-called hackerthons (hacker marathons) to actively push the development of m-apps based on government data. We model a typology of these m-apps and present a unique overview of the variety of types, used eco-systems and developers. For Android m-apps the success was measurable by the amount of counted downloads. Finally we argue that we are still in the beginning of citizen-oriented e-government and need more actionable research in this field.

<keywords> Information Behavior, Information Overload, Information Sharing, Filtering Strategy, Parenting
<topics> human information behavior, social informatics, cultural informatics
<abstract> This study investigates information seeking, sharing, and managing behaviors of “Gangnam mothers,” a group of dedicated Korean mothers who invest significant time and effort to micro- manage their child’s academic needs. These mothers’ vibrant and sophisticated information seeking and managing loads of education-related information sources is worthy of attention from information behavior research. To learn about their information behavior, field observations and interviews with mothers of school-aged children in Gangnam, the southern part of Seoul, have been conducted. The findings show that Gangnam mothers are personal information experts who heavily utilize human channels of information and employ local, group and personal filtering strategies. The fascinating information ecology of mothers in their diverse strategies for navigating and filtering information, coupled with the unique information environment in Gangnam, makes the flood of education-related information surprisingly manageable.

<title> Is there a Doctor in the Crowd? Diagnosis Needed! (for less than $5)
<keywords> crowdsourcing, human computation, Mechanical Turk, medical and health support
<topics> health informtics, information technology and work, distributed work
<abstract> We investigate the feasibility of crowd-based medical diagnosis by posting medical cases on a variety of crowdsourcing platforms: general and specialized volunteer question answering sites, and pay-based Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and oDesk. To assess the crowd’s ability to diagnose cases of varying difficulty, three sets of medical cases are considered. While volunteer channels proved ineffective for us, we discuss design limitations and opportunities for improvement. In contrast, Mechanical Turk workers without medical training not only correctly diagnosed easy cases, but also a previously unsolved case from CrowdMed involving extensive patient details. Likely due to varying expertise, MTurk workers and oDesk health professionals also differed in their willingness to provide uncertain diagnoses, diagnosis rationales, and reliance on personal experience with a disease to diagnose it.

<topics> human information behavior, qualitative research methods, online communities
<abstract> This study examined 300 question-“Best Answer” pairs from the LGBT thread of Yahoo! Answers to determine what information individuals find meaningful, relevant, and/or credible in interpreting an LGBT identity. Using a grounded approach, five main themes were identified that characterized information shared within the thread: a) defining an LGBT identity, b) romance, sex, and relationships, c) marginalizing others, d) coming out, and e) functioning as a community. Askers often solicited information regarding how to define and establish an LGBT identity, as well as how to engage in a sexual or romantic relationship. Answerers provided coming out metanarratives and framed LGBT individuals as being part of a community, providing askers with a discursive space to construct an LGBT identity for themselves. Askers and answerers also engaged in marginalization, within both heteronormative and essentialist contexts, which might affect how individuals continue or discontinue pursuing information related to an LGBT identity.

<topics> information technology and work, distributed work
<abstract> While many competitor platforms to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) now exist, little research has considered them. Such near-exclusive focus on AMT risks its particular vagaries and limitations overly shaping our understanding of crowd work and our field’s research questions and directions. To address this, we present a qualitative content analysis of seven alternative platforms. After organizing prior AMT studies around a set of key problem types encountered, we define our process for inducing categories for qualitative assessment of platforms. We then contrast the key problem types with AMT vs. platform features from content analysis, informing both methodology of use and directions for future research. Our cross-platform analysis represents the only such study by researchers for researchers, intended to enrich diversity of research on crowd work and accelerate progress.

<keywords> digital libraries, online communities, sociotechnical, information value, invisible work
<topics> social informatics, online communities
<abstract> This paper presents findings on the roles that two digital libraries and virtual book club communities, LibraryThing and Goodreads, play in the existing and emergent communities of their users. Informed by social informatics and sociotechnical theory and research, it improves our understanding of the phenomenon of information value and how shared information values are translated, cohered, and converged as users interact. LibraryThing and Goodreads play significant roles, but perfect coherence and convergence is not necessary in most cases; understanding differences and being willing to negotiate and translate around them allowed for continued use of the sites and for continued community existence and emergence. Translation was a significant factor in allowing common ground and social ties to be established, leading to greater information and knowledge sharing. Similar to maintaining “a real friendship,” these processes are often invisible work, but serve as significant factors in the sociotechnical infrastructure of LibraryThing and Goodreads.

<keywords> description, knowledge organization, library cataloging rules, ethics, metadata
<topics> history, theory and philosophy of information, information organization and metadata
<abstract> Information professionals describing resources are often faced with decisions around a resource’s formal identifying characteristics. Sometimes these characteristics, such as title or publication date, present information known to be deceptive, incorrect, or untrue in some way. Sometimes facts needed to identify the resource or help a user understand its nature are missing or incomplete. This paper identifies four ways resources fail to fully identify themselves, through unintentional error or inaccuracy; deception; simplifying complex reality; or humorous representation. It presents four categories of response that an information professional such as a library cataloger might engage: correct or clarify; reveal the hidden, missing, or disguised; assist users in navigating and understanding complex realities; no action or response. Response categories are illustrated with instructions from rules and guidelines representing two centuries of Anglo-American cataloging rules. The conclusion stresses the importance of these responses in facilitating a successful user experience with information systems.

<topics> information systems, distributed learning, sustainable computing
<abstract> This paper reconstructs the process of implementing e-Learning within a Vietnamese University. A case study approach incorporating interviews with relevant stakeholders including managers, faculty, and students is described. A thematic network analysis (TNA) is presented that identifies and categorises the organizational, pedagogical, and technological factors impinging on the different phases of the implementation process. The main finding of the TNA analysis is that it is organizational factors, both positive e.g. local culture, and negative e.g. bureaucratic structure, lack of management commitment, and unavailability of technology, which were the most significant factors in influencing the sustainability of e-Learning at the departmental and College levels. A configurational analysis is then presented that explains how the interdependence a) between organizational factors and other factors e.g. technological, pedagogical and organizational factors, and b) between organizational factors and each phase of the implementation process contributed in this case to a sustainable outcome. In conclusion suggestions are given as to how the process of implementing e-Learning in university settings can be improved through the adoption of a configurational approach.

<keywords> data processing, infrastructure, data-intensive science, qualitative methods
<topics> data science including digital curation and big data, infrastructure studies
<abstract> Data processing is work that scientists must undertake in order to make data useful for analyses, and is a key component of twenty-first century scientific research. The analysis of scientific data is contingent upon the successful collection or production and then processing of data. This qualitative research study, of four data-intensive research groups, investigates scientists engaging in data processing work practices to describe and analyze three distinctive but intertwined practices: cleaning data products, selecting a subset of a data product or assembling a new data product from multiple sources, and transforming data products into a common format. These practices are necessary for researchers to transform an initial data product in to one that is ready for scientific analysis. This research finds that data processing work requires a high level of scientific and technical competence that does not merely set up analyses, but also often shapes and is shaped by iterations of research designs and research questions themselves.

<title> A Method to Automatically Identify the Results from Journal Articles
<keywords> Machine learning, classification, scientific results, text categorization, feature selection
<topics> data analytics and evaluation, text/data/knowledge mining
<abstract> The idea of automating systematic reviews has been motivated by both advances in technology that have increased the availability of full-text scientific articles and by sociological changes that have increased the adoption of evidence-based medicine. Although much work has focused on automating the information retrieval step of the systematic review process with a few exceptions the information extraction and analysis have been largely overlooked. In particular, there is a lack of systems that automatically identify the results of an empirical study. Our goal in this paper is to fill that gap. We frame the problem as a classification task and employ three different objective, domain-independent feature selection strategies and two different classifiers. Additionally, special attention is paid to the selection of the data set used in this experiment, the feature selection metrics as well as the classification algorithms, and parameters of the algorithms used for classification in order to show the situatedness of this experiment and its dependence on each of the three parameters.

<topics> quantitative analyses including statistics, online communities
<abstract> This study examined the relationship between feedback and content posting behavior in the social media system Everything2. Analyses paired survey data with behavioral data of user activity obtained from server logs. Results showed that both positive and negative feedback from other users was associated with more posting behavior. Habit strength moderated the effect of positive feedback such that those with higher habit were less affected by the feedback than those with lower habit. Habit, however, did not moderate the effect of negative feedback. Results suggest that systems that facilitate positive feedback mechanisms may encourage initial participation but may become less effective for users who have developed a habit.

<topics> data analytics and evaluation, digital humanities, social informatics
<abstract> National housing social movement organizations transformed and publicly reconstructed their network structures online and offline during two different political environments (pre-housing bubble and post-housing bubble). This study investigates how this process takes place in a changing political environment. This study uses two different network types: an online hyperlink network and a network of co-participation in congressional hearings. Through a comparison of resources deployed and resulting social solidarities gathered and lost, this study found that during the United States economic recession during 2007–2010, network centrality has decreased in the hyperlink network where organizations have more agency. The majority of ties in the network of co-participation in congressional hearings were attributed to organizations of similar age and housing focus. Implications are discussed from theoretical, methodological, and practical points of view.

<topics> health informtics, human-computer interaction, personal informatics
<abstract> Wearable activity trackers are becoming widely adopted, yet challenges continue to exist in effective long-term use and adoption. Existing research focuses mostly on the use and adoption challenges associated with technical- or device-related issues and respective workaround strategies. Little is known about how personal preferences and other individual characteristics affect use and adoption of wearable activity trackers. In this paper, we present a six-week user study of 30 users using physical activity trackers embedded in clip-on and smart watch physical devices. We describe novel implications of the usage patterns, including the need to help people be mindful of their physical activity trackers, to understand and further articulate gender differences in use and adoption of wearable devices, to incorporate big data analytics in informing and coaching people’s practices, and to reframe data inaccuracy as a byproduct of mismanagement of expectations of the device’s capabilities and its expected usage.

<title> Information Presentation in Health Apps and Devices: The Effect of Color, Distance to Goal, Weight Perception, and Interest on Users’ Self-Efficacy for Accomplishing Goals
<keywords> information presentation, health, color, self-efficacy, design
<topics> quantitative analyses including statistics, health informtics, human-computer interaction
<abstract> Colors elicit different emotions and can impact behavior. However, few studies have examined the effects of color in health apps and devices. While these devices are becoming increasingly popular, little research has examined how the presentation of feedback within these technologies impacts users’ beliefs, such as self-efficacy. Yet understanding how information presentation affects users’ self-efficacy is important as self-efficacy is linked to successful behavior change. This study explores how manipulating the color of an exercise progress bar within a simulated health device influences users’ self-efficacy for completing today’s exercise goal and future exercise goals. This preliminary study aims to better understand how color choice, distance to goal, users’ weight perception, and interest in completing an exercise goal affect users' self-efficacy by simulating health app exercise progress bars. By understanding what influences self-efficacy, we can design better health apps and devices to increase the likelihood that users will reach their goals.

<title> Innovative Deviance: A Theoretical Framework Emerging at the Intersection of Copyright Law and Technological Change
<keywords> information policy, copyright law, mass digitization, innovative deviance
<topics> information policy and open access
<abstract> This paper explores the relationship between emerging technology-enabled behaviors and established copyright law in the United States. Challenges implicated by recent technological developments have given rise to a consensus among policy-makers, scholars, public interest advocates, and various other stakeholders that copyright reforms are needed. Debates over what shape the potential reforms ought to take have been strident, unrelenting, and seemingly paralyzing to the cause. Meanwhile, courts have continued to adjudicate cases testing the balance between existing copyright doctrines and new methods of creating, managing, and sharing protected works. The paper describes a recent exemplar involving mass digitization, Authors Guild v. HathiTrust, and critically reflects upon the courts’ fair use analyses before articulating an emerging theoretical framework for understanding and explaining the intersection of copyright law and technological change based on the sociological concept of innovative deviance.

<title> Seeking Information in Online Environments – Where, Who, and Why?
<keywords> Information seeking, social media, Q&A websites, web search engines
<topics> information seeking/retrieval, social media
<abstract> Given the ubiquity of social media and Web 2.0 resources, there is a current lack of knowledge about the complementary aspects of individualized and social search strategies. This paper looks at the information resource preferences of users, focusing on online resources. Two exploratory studies were done to analyze the motivations behind online information seeking behavior, specifically looking at where people go for information and reasons behind that decision. The first study collected log data from users who used the Web for browsing and searching information, and also asked questions on Q&A sites. The second study used a survey with four different scenarios that asked respondents to rank different information resources. The findings from these studies provide a more comprehensive understanding of how and why people choose to use an information resource/method depending on their information needs.

<keywords> Information Schemas, Narrative Knowledge Management, Actor Network Theory
<topics> information organization and metadata, social informatics, sustainable computing
<abstract> The paper explores an alternative approach to organizing information and data, based on categories of interest to local practice. It critiques current approaches to ontology and categorization schema development. An alternative approach is suggested, based on the analysis of networks of association contained in narrative accounts of the significance, context, and provenance of information. The approach is illustrated via a scenario based on the recording of information relevant to the analysis of unearthed artifacts in an archaeology research laboratory. The utility of this approach is contrasted with the formal system of information recording used in the laboratory, to demonstrate that one size does not fit all, in ontology design. The paper concludes that we need information recording tools that allow users to explore and develop categorization schemas based on practice. Such tools need to incorporate evolution of both categories and associations, to reflect experiential learning.

<keywords> Big science, little science, knowledge infrastructures, astronomy, microbiology
<topics> data science including digital curation and big data, knowledge management, infrastructure studies
<abstract> For decades, the big science and little science dichotomy has served as a starting point for many analyses of scientific research and data practices, including studies used to inform the construction of scientific knowledge infrastructures. We challenge this dichotomy by presenting findings from longitudinal, qualitative case studies of data lifecycles in two scientific domains, each centered around a large, distributed scientific collaboration. One is astronomy and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The other is the deep subseafloor biosphere and the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI). We show that some critical stages of the data lifecycle in each domain unfold in big science contexts while other critical stages occur in little science contexts. Furthermore, these big and little science contexts shape each other dynamically. This challenging of the big and little science dichotomy has implications for the building of scientific knowledge infrastructures, including those supporting data management.

<topics> data analytics and evaluation, information organization and metadata, text/data/knowledge mining
<abstract> "In large-scale digital libraries, it is not uncommon that some bibliographic fields in metadata records are incomplete or missing. Adding to the incomplete or missing metadata can greatly facilitate users' search and access to digital library resources. Temporal information, such as publication date, is a key descriptor of digital resources. In this study, we investigate text mining methods to automatically resolve missing publication dates for the HathiTrust corpora, a large collection of documents digitized by optical character recognition (OCR). In comparison with previous approaches using only unigrams as features, our experiment results show that methods incorporating higher order n-gram features, e.g., bigrams and trigrams, can more effectively classify a document into discrete temporal intervals or ""chronons"". Our approach can be generalized to classify volumes within other digital libraries."

<topics> human information behavior, information technology and work, infrastructure studies
<abstract> Infrastructure studies have focused attention on invisible work as a topic of concern for system design, pointing to the ways important roles may be lost if they are not recognized. This paper extends this engagement with invisible work by describing how conceptions of work in the classroom are influenced by material configurations. Based on ethnographic observations and a design intervention, I consider tensions between this invisible work and a group’s shared competence, arguing that altering material configurations can reveal invisible work and challenge existing conceptions and values. In the context of the collaborative work of the classroom this can result in the surfacing of individual perspectives that must be negotiated.

<topics> social media, quantitative analyses including statistics, social computing
<abstract> "Social media sites enable people to share milestones in their lives, but relatively little is understood about how and why they are used in the context of major life changes. We utilize social media as a lens to explore the behavior of individuals undergoing a major life transition -- those who use Twitter to announce that they are engaged to be married. Inspired by the anthropological concept ""liminality"", we identify behavior manifested in Twitter that characterize this transitional phase. A large-scale quantitative study of Twitter postings of engaged individuals spanning two years shows that this phase marks notable changes in behavior that can be gleaned from social media. A follow-up survey provides qualitative explanations for the statistical analysis. Our findings reveal how individuals may be utilizing social media in the context of a major milestone in life, and bear implications for social media design and applications."

<keywords> Mobile Crowdsourcing Systems, Public Safety, Paper Prototype
<topics> qualitative research methods, community informatics, human-computer interaction
<abstract> Safety on college campuses remains a dire issue. Current reporting methods are still cumbersome and include no enhancing social aspect. Given the unique opportunity that universities are required to publish their safety report logs, we conducted a preliminary data analysis of a university's safety report log. The analysis allowed us to detect relevant trends in reporting behavior, specifically pertaining to where, when, and how soon the community would report safety incidents. Motivated by these findings and by literature promoting interactive reporting systems, we designed a novel mobile app which aims to enable the spread of crowdsourced public safety information. This app allows for immediate mass sharing of self-reported safety incidents, as well as the opportunity for witness reporting. Feedback from a paper prototype interview study indicated that these qualities would facilitate increased interactivity among its user community, and ultimately promote awareness of campus safety.

<topics> history, theory and philosophy of information, human-computer interaction, information/computing ethics
<abstract> The rise of interest in online education from pedagogical, administrative, and technological perspectives presents numerous possibilities and challenges for researchers and practitioners, the most basic of which is the fundamental question of the determination of the concepts, categories, and values used to guide their work within this rapidly developing field. Drawing from contemporary discussions of the possibility for the instantiation of values and categories in the work of design, critical approaches to questions of technology and conceptual development surrounding the design of technological systems are discussed. It is argued that current value driven approaches to technological design, when refined and considered through a logic of conceptual deconstruction, offer a broad and open basis from which the direction of online education can best be considered. In the formulation of such an approach, general lessons for interaction design and information science as a whole can be found.

<title> Why do mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions struggle and how can we make them more effective?
<keywords> Mobile phone, Smoking Cessation, Text Message, Smart phone-based App
<topics> health informtics
<abstract> Tobacco epidemic has become one of the major threats for public health. Several intervention techniques have focused on this issue. However, due to high cost and inadequate accessibility, a vast majority of the smokers are unable to receive benefits from these interventions. Wide availability of mobile phones and growing number of users inspired researchers to utilize mobile phones as a cost-effective, accessible medium for designing smoking cessation interventions. Though promising, these interventions are struggling to support users’ needs. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of 69 articles available in four major databases (PubMed, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore). Our objective is to identify areas where cessation techniques succeeded and areas that remain challenging. We propose a set of implications guided by theories of cognitive dissonance, health behavior change, and assistive technologies that can inform future research, and guide the design of smoking cessation interventions.

<topics> data science including digital curation and big data, education in library and information sciences
<abstract> Scientific data centers have provided data services to research communities for decades and are invaluable educational partners for iSchools developing academic programs in data curation. This paper presents analyses from three years of internship placements at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and interviews with managers at prominent data centers across the country, as part of the Data Curation Education in Research Centers project. Key benefits of the internship program are identified, from the perspective of student learning and the contributions made by iSchool students to data center operations. The interviews extend the case results, providing evidence for potential data curation internship programs at data centers. The DCERC education model fosters integration of expertise across the iSchool and data center communities, enriching academic preparation with state-of-the-art practical experience in ways that are vital to the emerging data profession and its ability to meet the future demands of data-intensive research.

<abstract> As the ability to meaningfully process increasingly large quantities of data has improved, the need for systems to support the aggregation and subsequent use of disparate smaller datasets is correspondingly greater. The GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) is just one such project among a larger group seeking to aggregate the smaller, focused, and disparate sources of information generated for the work of science. GBIF is simultaneously an effort to coordinate and aggregate digital species occurrence data and digitize natural history collections into a single global-scale resource for biodiversity work. The basis for this paper is a critical study of the GBIF database and data portal as a socio-technical system.

<topics> communication studies, human information behavior, human-computer interaction
<abstract> An attempt to understand misinformation, and particularly the role the internet might play in it, suggests an emphasis on how individual internet users decide what to believe. Given the social nature of the internet, an essential component of belief formation must be an evaluation of cognitive authority and the means by which any knowledge source claims to have it. A content analysis of user comments about vaccine safety reveals the evaluation of cognitive authority to be a rich and complex set of negotiations among internet users. Certain characteristics of the internet seem to enhance the experience of evidence evaluation in ways that complicate underlying assumptions about how people believe. While the internet would seem to be a collection of secondhand knowledge, it is also rife with exaltation of firsthand knowledge as a superior, and uniquely accessible, means of knowing.

<abstract> In this study, we aim to reveal patterns of e-petition co-signing behavior that are indicative of political mobilization of online “communities” in the case of We the People (WtP), the first web-enabled petitioning system for the US federal government. This Internet-based tool enables users to petition the Obama Administration and solicit support for policy suggestions. Using WtP petition data, we focused on 33 petitions that were initiated the week after the Sandy Hook shooting (December 14-21, 2012) involving gun control and collectively received a response from President Obama. We apply Baumgartner and Jones’s (1993) work on agenda setting and punctuated equilibrium, which suggests that policy issues may lie dormant until a “focusing event” triggers the attention from political figures, interest groups, and the media. Using market basket analysis and social network analysis we found evidence of the mobilization of online communities for and against gun control laws and alternative policy proposals to address the Sandy Hook tragedy.

<keywords> older adults, technology adoption, loneliness and ICT use, social support, technology training for older adults
<topics> human information behavior, health informtics, community informatics
<abstract> Older adults often encounter diminished social support, loneliness and lower life satisfaction levels. Many of these struggles stem from a loss of social interaction with social network ties that are important to them. Information and communication technology (ICT) use offers promise in helping them maintain their social ties. In this longitudinal study, participants included 306 older adults in 19 different assisted and independent living communities. Through random assignment at the community level, residents were offered ICT training, interaction with trainees (placebo), and a survey only control condition with no interaction. Residents in each group were surveyed at pretest, posttest, and 3, 6, and 12 months post training. This analysis examines the use of the Internet as a tool for stress buffering to maintain and enrich social ties, reducing the impact of loneliness and improving life satisfaction measures. Significant interactions were found between ICT attitudes and loneliness, social support and life satisfaction.

<keywords> STEM, stereotype threat, computer intervention, minority, gender
<topics> digital youth, cultural informatics, education in library and information sciences
<abstract> To contribute to the growing field of STEM education, we examined the influence of stereotype threat on female and African American students in a large-scale computer intervention. Namely, this paper examines the relationship between gender and race and their effects on self-perceived technology efficacy, anxiety, STEM attitudes, and expectation of going to college. In total, 1,085 student survey responses were analyzed to understand the effects of stereotype threat on gender and race. The results suggest that gender was a consistent determinant of STEM attitudes and technology efficacy and race is a predictor of technological anxiety. For self-expectation of future education, gender and race were not predictors of the outcome variable. Instead, STEM attitudes and self-efficacy were positively associated with student’s self-expectation of going to college.

<abstract> In this paper, we investigate the role of sociocultural contexts and technological characteristics in user behaviors on social networking sites (SNSs). This study focuses on Korean mothers’ social roles and their use of KakaoStory—one of the most popular SNSs in Korea. Through interviews with fifteen Korean mother users, this research studies changing social roles of Korean mothers with childbirth, and its influence on KakaoStory use. Also, we investigate how KakaoStory’s unique characteristics affect mothers’ usage. The results of this study reveal that the primary child caregiver role of Korean mothers influences them to use KakaoStory to seek informational supports for childrearing and to perform their mothering duties. The photo-driven user interface and private service characteristic of KakaoStory fitted to the mothers’ need to share photos of children, with a restricted group of people. This study shed lights on the importance of the socio-technical perspective in the social media research.

<topics> communication studies, social informatics
<abstract> Opportunities for co-produced digital media find users differentially involved within emergent and unfamiliar configurations of technologies, organizations, and complex information flows. Addressing the interaction patterns and rhetorical practices of the most frequent contributors to online discussion forums in comparison to the majority of infrequent contributors, this analysis considers the contributions of each toward the structuring of online discourse. An empirical analysis found an inverse ratio between the monologues and replies of frequent contributors and those users posting a single comment. Although both groups tended to engage in interpretive practices, frequent contributors more often interacted in direct reply with others, often in sharp critique or supportive acknowledgement. These findings suggest that frequent contributors perform a significant role in the emergent structuring of online discourse.

<keywords> Creativity, Rapid Prototyping, 3D Modeling, Making; Design
<topics> human-computer interaction, information technology and work
<abstract> Despite the prevalence of affordable “maker” tools such as 3D printers and laser cutters, actually creating digital models remains out of the reach of most everyday users. Even when users are able to design or fabricate items, some everyday users may be more interested in modifying or replacing objects that they already own rather than inventing new items. Addressing the needs of these users requires taking a different approach than that taken by most computer-aided design tools. To address this need, we introduce the notion of design from imperfect examples, in which existing objects are scanned and modified to create new objects. We present examples of this design approach and describe the development and formative evaluation of the Easy Make Oven, a prototyping tool that enables novice users to create simple 3D designs based on their existing possessions.

<keywords> Assessment, CSCL, Activity Theory, Spectral Clustering, Automation
<topics> community informatics, social computing, distributed learning
<abstract> Enabling the formative assessment of students while limiting demands on teachers’ time is a significant concern for technology mediated learning in small groups. Previous approaches have either required extensive time commitments on the part of teachers or relied on the development of special computational models of behavior. Oftentimes, these models overlook the way in which traces of student interaction in a learning system also constitute traces of human behavior, and, act only as “blunt instruments” relying only on the automated accounting of student activities. We employ activity theory to categorize traces of student behavior captured from a Virtual Math Teams (VMT) geometry class in an online, synchronous environment. From this, six semantically-grounded measures are generated for each student. Using these, a recently-developed clustering algorithm – spectral clustering – is coded to identify students who have similar behavior patterns. Structured in such a fashion, the theoretical and computational approach taken allows for an automated and meaningfully-grounded assessment of student performance, enabling teachers to offer concrete and personalized help in a timely format.

<topics> information policy and open access, qualitative research methods, community informatics
<abstract> This discourse analysis examines the professional conversation about public library makerspaces. Articles describe makerspaces filled with advanced technological gadgets and high-tech users. This discourse brushes past familiar ways of making, such as fiber crafts or painting, to emphasize novel forms of digitally-mediated creativity. Interviews with public librarians offering makerspace services describe a more gradual evolution from long-standing library activities and creative programming to include some digital tools and some traditional tools. This research examines the tropes in the discourse, to identify legitimated ideologies or interpretive schemes. It further considers how the rhetoric might impede or facilitate public library principles such as equal access. The analysis identifies strategies and tactics for institutional control and individual agency in the process of structuring the makerspaces, revealing dissonance between the printed texts and interview discourse. As more librarians create makerspaces, this institutional discourse shapes a path for others to follow.

<abstract> In a learning management system (LMS), students leave a trail of data that they produce in a course. Learning management systems are equipped with visualizations that provide the instructor with information about the student’s activity or behavior. This poster will present initial findings from an exploratory study that tells the story of what these students know, feel and understand about how their data is used by instructors in learning environments. In this pilot study, five students participated in semi-structured interviews and narrative writing to describe their impression of how and why instructors would use student data in teaching and learning. The interviews and narratives were coded for patterns using an ethical reasoning framework. Initial findings indicate that while these students think it is fair for instructors to use their data for instructional purposes, it may affect how they behave in the learning management system.

<keywords> open access, scholarly publishing, LIS faculty, survey methods
<topics> information policy and open access, informetrics and scholarly communication, quantitative analyses including statistics
<abstract> Open access (OA) scholarly publishing has grown steadily in academia for the past few decades as an alternative to traditional subscription-based journal publishing, particularly as concerns mount over the affordability of periodicals. This poster presents an initial analysis of a systematic survey of North American Library and Information Science (LIS) faculty attitudes towards and experiences with OA publishing. This work demonstrates that a majority of LIS faculty do agree that major changes need to be made to the current state of scholarly communication, and that a majority of LIS faculty see OA journals as comparable to traditional, subscription based peer-reviewed journals. However, OA publication behaviors are not equal across faculty rank, and tenure track faculty are not publishing in OA journals at the same rate as their tenured colleagues. Tenure-track faculty also have higher rates of indicating they believe promotion/tenure committees will evaluate OA journal publications as less favorable than traditional, subscription based peer-reviewed journals. The findings from this study raise important questions about overcoming barriers to OA participation.

<title> How Does TED Talk? A Preliminary Analysis
<keywords> TED Talks, linguistics, CMC, science communication
<topics> communication studies, natural language processing, text/data/knowledge mining
<abstract> TED Talks is one of the leading science communication initiatives in the digital age. Although previous work has analyzed the demographics of speakers & audience reaction to TED Talks, there is a dearth of research into the actual content of these talks. The transcripts for TED videos were downloaded from the official TED website and analyzed as to word use by different speaker classes (male academics, female academics, male non-academics, and female non-academics). The two subpopulations (males vs. females; academics vs. non-academics) exhibited marked differences in the words that they used during their talks, which may indicate different sentiments, topical preoccupations, and goals for the presentation. Gender was an important variable throughout the study, indicating an issue worthy of further investigation.

<title> Determining the User Intent of Chinese-English Mixed Language Queries Based On Search Logs
<keywords> Information retrieval, multilingual search query, user intent, search behavior, search log analysis
<topics> human information behavior, information seeking/retrieval, social informatics
<abstract> With the increasing number of multilingual web pages on the Internet, multilingual information retrieval has become an important research topic. While queries are the key element of information retrieval process, mixed-language queries have not yet been adequately studied. This study is to determine the user intents of Chinese-English mixed-language queries submitted to a Chinese search engine, and compares the user intents identified by query content to those identified using additional user behavior data (e.g. clicked results, subsequent queries). The preliminary findings present the distributions of user intents by analyzing query only and additional user behavior data, suggesting a specific searching behavior of Chinese-English mixed-language queries users. The findings of this study could provide useful insights in understanding the searching behavior of Chinese-English mixed-language queries users, and enable web search engines to provide users with more relevant results and more precisely targeted sponsored links.

<keywords> digital preservation, cultural heritage, system evaluation
<topics> cultural institutions, sustainable computing, archives and records
<abstract> Whereas large cultural heritage institutions have made significant headway in providing digital preservation for archival assets—such as by setting-up geographically redundant digital repositories— medium and small institutions have struggled to meet minimum digital preservation standards. This project will explore one option for enhancing the digital preservation capacity for very low-resourced environments. FixityBerry is a project which connects consumer-grade USB hard disks to the $35 Raspberry Pi computer, which checks file fixity weekly and powers down when checking is complete. This poster will report out on an eight-month pilot of using FixityBerry to monitor the digital assets from several small cultural heritage institutions.

<title> Implications and Potential Impacts of Information Behavior Research
<keywords> Information behavior; user studies; research implications
<topics> human information behavior
<abstract> This pilot study identifies how information behavior (IB) researchers address implications and potential impacts of their study results—the “so what?” questions. Thirty IB research articles were randomly selected from refereed journals published in the U.S. and Canada between 2008 and 2012. Each article was coded to capture types and characteristics of their stated implications. Twenty-three articles offered practical implications and seven provided both scholarly and practical implications. This poster presents the patterns of implications generated by the articles analyzed. We make suggestions to facilitate generating stronger implications, which will ultimately strengthen the impact of IB studies and contribute to advancing IB research.

<title> The Effects of Expert and User Ratings on Behavioral Intentions on a UGC Site
<keywords> Behavioral intention, expert ratings, user rating, experiment
<topics> human information behavior, social media, quantitative analyses including statistics
<abstract> The study examines whether expert and user ratings affect students’ behavioral intentions to use a fictitious book at Goodreads.com, a user-generated content (UGC) site regarding books. It also explores students’ perceptions of others’ susceptibility regarding user ratings. Data were collected using both an experiment and a web survey in fall 2013. A total of 206 surveys were useable for this research. The findings show that only expert ratings affected students’ behavioral intentions to use a book. Students tended to perceive others as being more influenced by user ratings than they, themselves, were. The results indicate that experts’ opinions still continue to be important for accepting the object of ratings on UGC sites. In addition, despite the need for more evidence, the influence of user ratings on, at least students’ intentional behavior, may not be as strong as expected.

<title> Searching for Movies: An Exploratory Analysis of Movie-related Information Needs
<keywords> movies, every-day life information behavior, relevance, recommendation, search
<topics> human information behavior, information seeking/retrieval
<abstract> Despite a surge in popularity of work on casual leisure search, some leisure domains are still relatively underrepresented. Movies are good example of such a domain, which is peculiar given the popularity of movie-centered websites and discovery services such as IMDB, RottenTomatoes, and Netflix. In this paper, we present an exploratory analysis of IMDB movie discussion threads that contain requests for movies to watch. Through emergent coding we produce a taxonomy of relevance aspects for movie search and selection. Our analysis shows that topical aspects, such as content, metadata, and known-item search, are important for movie selection practices. Other requests focus more on recommendation and feature many subjective relevance aspects, such as the tone of a movie or its intended audience. This suggests efficient access to movies is likely to require different information access paradigms to satisfy all the movie-related information needs expressed in the threads.

<title> Privacy and Cloud Computing in Public Libraries: The Case of BiblioCommons
<keywords> Privacy, cloud computing, library ethics, patron privacy, information policy
<topics> information policy and open access, information systems, information/computing ethics
<abstract> Public libraries are increasingly turning to cloud computing solutions to satisfy their technological needs in order to best serve patrons, while simultaneously taking advantage of new opportunities for cost savings, flexibility, and enhanced data management. These cloud services are typically provided by third parties who have built robust solutions to help libraries deliver resources, services, and expertise efficiently, while also encouraging patrons to socialize and leverage the power of the community of users. The use of cloud computing in libraries, however, has the potential to disrupt longstanding ethical norms within librarianship dedicated to protecting patron privacy. While librarians have historically engaged in professional practices that limit retention of patron data and protected confidentiality, cloud computing platforms are largely based on the tracking, collection, and aggregation of user data. This poster will report on a pilot study to help us understand how libraries address, if at all, issues of patron privacy in the use of third-party cloud computing services.

<topics> communication studies, qualitative research methods, social media
<abstract> With an increasing number of Individuals with Intellectual Disorders (IID), there is a building concern about the amount of resources available for the families affected. The focus of this research is on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). According to the Center for Disease Control, the prevalence rates have nearly doubled within the last century. This study aims to study what trends are prevalent among caregivers of autistic individuals in terms of why they resort to social networks. This study was conducted by observing an online forum through the social network, Facebook, and collecting a set of one-hundred randomized posts over a time span of thirty-days. Results concluded that families, especially parents, faced risk of psychological distress resulting from isolation and confusion. This has the potential to become a primary avenue for communication within health care industries and families with IID. Future implications of this study regards the importance of social networks in communicating with patients with future research needed in the area of mobile health networks.

<title> Parent-Child Dialogues and Artifact Control Behavior in Computer vs. Non-Computer Mediated Parental Interactions
<keywords> artifact mediation, parental interaction, parent-child activities
<topics> digital youth, human information behavior, human-computer interaction
<abstract> The importance of parent-child dialogues in child development has been widely recognized. Also acknowledged in the literature is that an artifact in an activity mediates and influences the activity’s objective. Yet previous studies have not examined the relationships between the types of the parent-child activities and their behavior with respect to engaging in a dialogue and controlling the artifact. Addressing this research gap, we analyzed the videos of five math and design activities that eight parent-child groups participated over one month period of time. Our results reveal that the type of activities did not influence the frequency of group members’ having a dialogue in an activity, but affected the length of a dialogue. Specifically, the length of a group’s dialogue was much longer in the math activities Also, each member controlled artifact(s) more often in math activities. While the children controlled the artifact(s) longer in the design activities than in the math activities, it was the opposite pattern in the parents’ case.

<topics> digital humanities, information architecture, information systems
<abstract> The HathiTrust (HT) digital library comprises 4 billion pages (composing 11 million volumes). The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) – a unique collaboration between University of Illinois and Indiana University – is developing tools to connect scholars to this large and diverse corpus. This poster discusses HTRC’s activities surrounding the discovery, formation and optimization of useful analytic subsets of the HT corpus (i.e., workset creation and use). As a part of this development we are prototyping a RDF-based triple-store designed to record and serialize metadata describing worksets and the bibliographic entities that are collected within them. At the heart of this work is the construction of a formal conceptual model that captures sufficient descriptive information about worksets, including provenance, curatorial intent, and other useful metadata, so that digital humanities scholars can more easily select, group, and cite their research data collections based upon HT and external corpora. The prototype’s data model is in being designed to be extensible and fit well within the Linked Open Data community.

<topics> information seeking/retrieval, human-computer interaction
<abstract> Given the prevalence of digital resource use in education, it is critical to understand teachers’ interactions and perceptions when retrieving digital video for instructional purposes. The overarching objective of the present study was to examine how user-centric measures varied between different groups of science teachers, formed on certain user characteristics. An experimental methodology, including a set of interactive search experiments with actual users, was employed to explore these research objectives. Findings showed influences in interactive video retrieval tied to user characteristics, such as gender, age, and educational context. Examining teachers’ use and perceptions of digital video provides system designers and information professionals understanding that can contribute to more effective resources.

<abstract> Surveys were collected to analyze perceived self-efficacy within interactive video retrieval, overall and according to certain factors potentially significant to users’ confidence prior to a search session. A total of 214 surveys with quantifiable responses were collected and analyzed. The combined mean of participants’ perceived self-efficacy for being able to successfully fulfill certain video needs was 3.24 (out of 5). Independent samples t-tests produced significantly higher levels of perceived self-efficacy among participants more familiar with a sample information topic (t=-3.51, p<0.01) and among those completing the survey using YouTube as the system context versus the CSPAN Digital Video Library (t=3.78 and p<0.01). Findings give researchers better understanding of users’ confidence and beliefs prior to an interactive video retrieval process, which can demonstrate implications for use and acceptance of interactive video systems.

<title> Social Approach for Interpersonal Information Behavior Research in Academic Contexts
<keywords> Interpersonal Information Behavior, Academic Context, Social Approach, Cognitive Approach
<topics> human information behavior
<abstract> The authors discuss the relative strengths of using the social approach to examine interpersonal information behavior in academic contexts. Many researchers investigating the information activities of scholars, undergraduates, and graduate students have focused on work-related aspects using information seeking behavior frameworks derived from the cognitive approach. However, the cognitive approach suffers from lack of sufficient explanations about interpersonal sources and often regards people solely as intermediaries whose role is limited to providing referral services. Using the social approach, however, allows researchers to explore both work-related and daily life information activities comprehensively and to understand interpersonal sources in a much broader sense. Future work will investigate interpersonal information behaviors in mentoring using the social approach.

<abstract> In this work-in-progress poster, we examine the relationship between societal variables, including cultural attributes, and users' self-disclosure on Facebook. To accomplish this we use a dataset of 425,000 Facebook users who designated a national or regional network. Drawing on both standard demographic control variables and the GLOBE cultural dimensions, we execute an exhaustive model search. The best-performing model confirms our hypotheses about cultural variables, but some of our hypotheses about demographic controls are negated. Consequently, we discuss directions in which to continue our research.

<abstract> Facebook’s recent implementation of “custom” gender options and gender-neutral pronouns provided transgender and gender-non-conforming users with new ways to represent gender identity online. We analyze user response to and use of these affordances. We found that while many transgender and gender non-conforming Facebook users used and appreciated the new options for gender representation, the system still constrained self-presentation for some. Additionally, use of custom gender options complicated gender identity disclosure for many participants. Results highlight tensions around the ability of classification systems to categorize identities.

<title> Effects of Social Networking Sites on User Experience
<keywords> Social Networking Sites, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, User Experience
<topics> qualitative research methods, social media
<abstract> Social Networking Sites (SNS) introduced a new medium of communication among users. Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn share several notable features between sites, while maintaining distinct user experiences. This study investigated users’ experience and ownership of accounts on multiple SNS. 40 undergraduate students, 18-24 years old, were surveyed and all 40 had Facebook accounts. Only 24 students had accounts with Google+ and 15 owned a LinkedIn account. Results showed the most significant factor affecting satisfactory user experience was the popularity of the site among users’ social circles, with the features of the site being less valued by users. The perception of a site’s purpose and how to use its features to network effectively also greatly impacted user experience. Facebook was a gold standard in that its features were present in other SNS. Further results found that although users expressed a desire for customizability, they rarely took advantage of such opportunities.

Students gain insight into work with research data through online exploration of a data repository as well as via contact with a repository information professional. Four major elements of a student data collection curation project are described: selecting a data collection, developing a draft data curation plan, keeping a data collection activity log, and summarizing via formative and summative reports. The data curation project provided an experience mix of the curation culture and its services with data generating research cultures and their emergent practices.

<topics> human information behavior, health informtics
<abstract> Social Q&A sites have been emerging as a platform for people to seek information and social supports around health topics. Identifying users’ information needs from the questions can significantly help social Q&A sites serve their users better. Prior research had attempted to understand askers’ intentions and implicit needs by classifying hidden intent from questions, while the non-trivial categorization was only able to be conducted with a limited size of data. In this study, we aim to develop a scalable categorization method that can categorize the askers’ intent in a large set of health-related questions via crowdsourcing. We conducted a preliminary experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate our categorization method. Our results suggests both challenges and opportunities for understanding health information intent via crowdsourcing.

<abstract> User-generated online communities such as online discussion boards have become an importance element of life in information society. However, their success is accompanied with challenges. Particularly, their high reliance on user-generate content makes ensuring a continuous flow of newcomers vital to their existence. Newcomers face various difficulties due to their lack of commitment and familiarity with the community and many online communities experience high quitting rate of newcomers. In the current work, we aim to study how self-disclosure can be used as a mechanism to encourage more effort and commitment from newcomers. We present our results from exploring the relationship between self-disclosure and newcomers’ effort and commitment in an online community. Our results show that self-disclosure has significant positive associations with newcomers’ subsequent effort in the community.

<topics> qualitative research methods, social media, online communities
<abstract> Although many SNSs experienced great popularity in the past few years, it is also worth noting that most of them were confronted with massive and abrupt recession in a short period of time. In this study, we define the user exodus as a large scale movement in and out of the social media market, and it can be viewed as a decision or response in the post-adoption stage of IT artifact. So far, there is no currently agreed model for user exodus behavior. Thus, this research-in-progress study aims to qualitatively investigate the underlying reasons of user exodus by examining Kaixin001, a Chinese SNS product. Ethnography decision tree model (EDTM) will be built to elicit the attributes and laddering technique will be used to establish the connections between various attributes, consequences, and the values following means-end chain (MEC) theory. Preliminary findings from content analysis are presented.

<abstract> We present initial results from a project, in which we examined feasibility of inferring web page relevance from eye-tracking data. We conduced a controlled, lab-based Web search experiment, in which participants conducted assigned information search tasks on Wikipedia. We performed analyses of variance as well as employed classification algorithms in order to predict user perceived Web page relevance. Our findings demonstrate that it is feasible to infer document relevance from eye-tracking data on Web pages. The results indicate that eye fixation duration, pupil size and the probability of continuing reading are good predictors of Web page relevance. This work extends results from previous studies of text document search conducted in more constrained environments.

<abstract> The fast growth of social media has reshaped the traditional way of human interaction and information seeking behavior, which draws research attention on characterizing the new information seeking paradigm. However, results from previous studies might not be well grounded under certain social settings. In this paper, we leverage machine learning techniques to identify different types of question tweets within academic communities as an example of one particular social context. By studying over 160 thousands of tweets posted by 30 academic communities, we discovered a different landscape of information-seeking behaviors, where less tweets are regarded as question tweets, and more real information-seeking tweets are observed. We also found that users respond differently with different types of question tweets. We believe our study would be beneficial for understanding the information seeking behaviors in social media.

<topics> information services, qualitative research methods, ICT4D (information and communication technology for development)
<abstract> Market Information Systems (MIS) developed for farmers in the Global South with the goal of providing them with different types of agricultural information are failing to be widely adopted. We argue that this is because they are designed on the basis of a universalistic idea of how markets (should) work, and how abstract information circulates (or does not). Drawing from our study of information practices in rural Indian and Chinese agricultural communities, we suggest three dimensions that need to be considered in order to design MIS that are more aligned with the actual needs of their targeted users, and the micro and macro contexts in which they live. The first is the range of roles and policies at play in the functioning of a market; followed by the identity of the actors in these roles; and finally by existing information-sharing practices and media (radio and television) involved in the working of the market.

<keywords> Information behavior, culture, cognitive behavior, cross-cultural, human information interaction
<topics> human information behavior, cultural informatics, human-computer interaction
<abstract> The purpose of this ongoing doctoral study is to identify if cultural differences affect information-searching behavior of Google users. Even though cultural differences have been the main concern of several information behavior studies in the last 10 years, there is only one study (e.g. Dong & Lee, 2008) that examined the differences in webpage information perception from Nisbett’s cultural cognitive perspective (Nisbett et al., 2001; Nisbett & Norenzayan, 2002). Also, there are only a limited number of studies that investigate cognitive differences between Middle Eastern (mainly Arabs) and Western online information seekers. This study aims at addressing this gap by comparing Americans and Iranians online information searching behavior through the lens of cultural cognition with the use of eye tracking and mouse tracking technologies.

<title> Academic Social Networking Sites: A Comparative Analysis of Their Services and Tools
<keywords> Academic Social Network Sites, Social Media, Academics
<topics> informetrics and scholarly communication, social media, personal informatics
<abstract> In the last decade there has been an emergence of Academic Social Networking Sites (ASNSs). Each site offers its own combination of tools and capabilities to support research activities, communication, collaboration, and networking. Given their variety, it might be challenging for academics to evaluate and use them. We conducted an exploratory inductive comparative study of the services and tools of a select set of ASNSs. We argue that maintaining multiple profiles might be time-consuming and propose starting a discussion about how we can make this process less cumbersome. We expect that our findings will help academics and researchers make informed decisions about their choice of ASNS.

<title> Play across networks: An ethnography of information behavior in online gaming
<keywords> digital games, information behavior, affinity spaces, digital youth, minecraft
<topics> digital youth, human information behavior, social media
<abstract> Our work details the process by which a young gamer accesses information and social resources in gameplay. We first frame this practice using the literacy studies concept of affinity spaces. Then, using ethnographic data from both our participant’s online and offline life, we describe the way that he uses several disparate spaces for specific reasons, and stitches these spaces together through ongoing voice communication using Skype. We conclude with two provocations for future research: 1) that the process of combining multiple spaces into a single space should be explored in greater depth, and 2) that the use of Skype as the common communicative platform raises further questions regarding the way that the physical self is backgrounded and foregrounded in digital gameplay.

<title> Personal Information Categorization: The Rigid, Fuzzy, and Flexible Categorizers
<keywords> categorization, information organization, information behavior, personal information management
<topics> human information behavior, information organization and metadata, personal informatics
<abstract> This research study investigated and identified different styles of personal information categorization based on three types of mindsets in cognitive sociology. To collect data, a demographic questionnaire, a diary study, and two semi-structured interviews were conducted with each of 18 participants. To analyze data, content analysis of the diary and the interviews were conducted. The results show that there are three different styles of personal information categorization: (1) the rigid categorizer; (2) the fuzzy categorizer; and (3) the flexible categorizer. It is critical to understand different styles of categorization as it is directly related to developing and designing personal information management devices and applications that support personal information organization. The findings from this study also broaden our understanding of categorization, personal information management, and information behavior.

<title> Critical factors leading to ERP replacement in Higher Education Institutions in Saudi Arabia: preliminary results
<keywords> Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Higher Education Institutions (HEIs); Grounded Theory (GT)
<topics> information systems
<abstract> Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has been extensively researched with regard to the business environment, but not so much in relation to higher education institutions (HEIs). The review of the available ERP literature outlined ERP adoption, implementation and success cases as the main areas of research. By contrast, fewer studies have addressed the challenges and problems associated with replacement of one ERP system with another. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature by investigating the case study of a large university from Saudi Arabia in which the local ERP system was replaced with SAP ERP. According to the preliminary results obtained, the decision to replace an ERP system is influenced by several important factors. These factors were trend pressure, dependency on foreign experts, poor integration and public negativity. This paper presents a summary of these perceived factors.

<abstract> Keyword metadata is very important to the retrieval and management of scientific publications. However, keyword sparseness, in the scientific repository, threatens the usability, and manually assigning keywords is laborious and inefficiency. In this study, we investigate an automatic keyword assigning approach based on full-text citation analysis and supervised topic model, which can characterize the semantic relation between keyword label and the contextual meaning. Full-text citation network is constructed with publication topic distribution and citation topical motivation, which may potentially enhance the keyword label performance.

<title> Distilling jargon: A case study examining the efficacy of government information visualizations
<keywords> government information; visualization; intelligibility; policy
<topics> information policy and open access, information services, information visualization
<abstract> In 2010, the federal government passed the Plain Writing Act, a piece of legislation that calls for clearly and concisely written government information. While this statute focuses on textual communication, its passage illustrates the government’s broader concerns with improving the accessibility of all government information. The same principles should guide the creation of non-textual communications, including visualizations intended to illustrate and accompany government information. This poster applies a case study approach to consider how current visualization methods and techniques might be modified in the future to more equitably distill government jargon. The case study looks at the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and how this act is currently being visualized for lay audiences. We compare and contrast the text and visual versions of the ACA to examine what information is lost when concepts are transferred into visual format, as well to consider the efficacy of the visualization.

<title> An academic nomad? : Identity formation of iSchool students
<keywords> identity formation, interdisciplinary programs, iSchools, graduate students, research
<topics> education in library and information sciences
<abstract> Students come to an iSchool program with a passion for exciting and novel research which they perceive as being rare in traditional disciplinary areas. However, the range of freedom allowed in conducting research at iSchools sometimes poses unexpected difficulties for students. This study aims to identify the unique problems that graduate students in an interdisciplinary iSchool program encounter when designing a research project. A qualitative content analysis method is used to analyze students’ responses regarding the difficulties they have experienced. The findings indicate that the difficulties, which range from a paradox of choice in determining a research topic to communicating the implications of their research outcomes, generally point to a problem of identity formation. This study argues that students’ identity problems have been overshadowed by the hype of interdisciplinary studies and that helping students establish a solid identity within iSchool programs is necessary to produce healthy and confident researchers.

<abstract> The mythology of information determinism – that access to the “right” information will precipitate desired actions – is common in policy arenas and develop. We identify information determinism in three programs in international development, education, and disaster response, describing their information deterministic framing and the implications of the mythology of information in action. As an alternative, we propose the framework of “information orders” to provide a more grounded framework for understanding the production and circulation of information in policy or development projects.

<keywords> representation, object performance, information-sharing, art, community.
<topics> qualitative research methods
<abstract> This study examines the narratives of All Souls artists and performers in Tucson, Arizona asking how artists learn about, share information on, and make meaning through a large-scale event and in their art. This work focuses on, in particular, the idea that objects are more than material products, they are a center point in the meanings attached to as well as the learning processes involved in the performance itself. Methodologically, this paper builds on in-depth qualitative interviews with artists – both expert and novice – involved in the procession. This research is based on observational notes taken at differing temporal points leading up to the event, across two years of parades, preparation, and celebration. Interview transcripts are treated as narratives and examined in light of notes taken in the field to address the following research question: What does it mean for artists to teach about, learn about, and engage in object performance when representing their experiences of death and dying through the All Souls Procession?

<abstract> Publishing academic work has been recognized as a key indicator for measuring scholars’ scientific productivity and having crucial impact on their future career. However, little has been known about how the majority of researchers progress in publishing papers across disciplines. In this work, using a collection consisting of over five millions academic publications across 15 disciplines, we study how the scientific productivity patterns of junior scholars change across different generations and different domains. Our study results help understand the evolution of the competitive “publish or perish” academic culture.

<abstract> Many people use the Internet for their health information needs. Individuals searching for health information can bombarded with resources. Some of these resources can me poor or give misinformation. It is important for individuals to be able to understand what resources are reputable and give the most accurate information. eHealth Literacy Scales (eHEALS) were developed to address some of these challenges. This study examined how eHealth literacy (direct and indirect) and affected the eHealth literacy on colon cancer screening test using Structure Equation Modeling (SEM). This study also analyzed what other factors, such as socioeconomic characteristics (SES) and Internet usage, influenced eHealth literacy and the colon cancer screening. The study examined the data of 108 adult participants. Among SES, race has a direct affect on the Internet usage and also a direct affect on the eHealth literacy. However, eHealth literacy does not directly affect on colon cancer screening.

<keywords> digital humanities, digital preservation, knowledge infrastructure, sustainability, user analysis
<topics> digital humanities, knowledge management, sustainable computing
<abstract> This study takes contemporary user analysis of historical digital objects as a central component of a responsible digital preservation strategy. The direct object of inquiry is a scholarly website, “Images of Medieval Art and Architecture” (http://www.medart.pitt.edu), created in 1995 at the very dawn of the World Wide Web. This site continues to serve a global community of scholars who investigate the art and architecture of Western Europe between the eighth and fourteenth centuries, and has become the de facto reference standard for study images for this period. Although the web presence has benefitted from some minor updates, the digital object has remained more or less untouched for the past two decades, a period of drastic change in the surrounding digital environment. Using a usability analysis survey that examines the intellectual, aesthetic, and technical elements of this important digital humanities project, this early-stage study reveals the ways in which contemporary functional and aesthetic interactions can identify important preservation criteria that need to be addressed when designing long-term preservation strategies.

<abstract> Many existing metrics to evaluate scholars only concern their scientific impact and omit the importance of breadth of research. In this poster, we define a new metric for breadth of research based on the generalized Stirling metric which considers many aspects of breadth of research and satisfies several axioms for breadth of metrics. Also experiments on the ACM dataset show weak correlation between breadth of research measured by our new metric and scientific impact. And the variation of our metric over time illustrates a possible publication pattern for scholars.

<abstract> Using a combination of quantitative surveys conducted over 11 weeks, which reached 68 participants, and qualitative interviews collecting personal stories from two participants, our research team examined the general Latina experience within the academic and professional STEM community. The central hypothesis supporting this study was that Latinas in STEM experienced a sense of alienation and a general lack of support which discouraged them from both entering into and remaining in a STEM field. Our results did not broadly support this hypothesis: within our pool of respondents, the issue of alienation and lack of support was not statistically present, but this and similar issues were addressed strongly in qualitative responses, discouraging a full rejection of our original hypothesis.

<abstract> This study investigated the influence between industry and scholarly communication with the comparative analysis of patterns using a large scale dataset on biometric information. To identify whether patterns of cutting edge development in industry affects, are affected by, and/or are studied in parallel with scholarly communication over time, trending topics, word frequency occurrences, and temporal burst detection over time were conducted to assess prominent terms. Patents published in USPTO from 1790 to 2014 were analyzed to represent industry, and published documents such as peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and ebooks from both Thomson Reuters Web of Science and IEEE Xplore were analyzed to represent scholarly communication. The results of this study revealed that (1) there are matching trends in the number of publications, (2) transformation points in time are detected using the temporal burst analysis, and (3) patterns of cutting edge developments in industry might not affect, be affected by, and/or develop in parallel with scholarly communication over time in biometric literature.

<abstract> Writing collaboratively is increasing in many professions, including among college students. Students are writing many assignments collaboratively, learning as they go. Writing collaboratively, however, takes coordination and awareness of who has done what. We offer a new tool, DocuViz, which displays the entire revision history of Google Docs, showing more than the one-step-at-a-time kind of snapshot currently available in Docs and Word. Using DocuViz, we analyzed 99 students’ reports from a Project Management class and found it to reveal interesting patterns of collaborative writing. We believe this tool would be useful not just for researchers, but also for the authors themselves and instructors.

<abstract> For projects of moral and ethical import, designers and researchers are frequently motivated by notions of justice. However, it is unclear how justice influences design process. Within a participatory design process aimed at food access issues, I traced how concepts of justice manifested, were used when introduced, and under what conditions were concepts of justice ignored or laid aside for other concerns. This analysis produced several categories of design strategies participants employed to navigate complex ethical discussion around issues of food access. Within the design process, these design strategies included designing artifacts that were expanding food options, utilizing local resources, and localizing control. These results highlight the complex worlds in which these concepts of justice were situated within during the design process and inform how to support designers developing socially beneficial technologies while working alongside local communities.

<keywords> Physical activity-tracking devices; intrinsic motivation; extrinsic motivation; quantified-selfers
<topics> human information behavior, health informtics, online communities
<abstract> Interest in consumer tracking devices that measure movement to help consumers track and understand their daily activities has rapidly increased in recent years. Although a few studies have focused on the use of fitness tracking devices, we know little about how users’ existing motivation is complemented by motivation externally created from the device or how interplay between this external motivation and preexisting internal motivation of users affects use of the device over an extended period of time. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 Fitbit users in an academic institution to understand the multidimensional nature of motivation that shapes the long-term use of technology and its effects, and we found that Quantified-Selfers may have distinct motivation to use tracking devices. In the next step, we plan to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Quantified Self online forum in order to explore Quantified-Selfers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for using the device and tracking their activity data.

<keywords> Responsive Web Design, Mobile Design, Academic Library Website
<topics> human-computer interaction, information systems
<abstract> Responsive web design (RWD) allows a single website to support multiple screen sizes. By using a single-site approach instead of maintaining separate full-size and mobile websites, smartphones can access all website features instead of a subset. This study examined smartphone use of a new academic RWD library website to find out which features are used on small devices. An intriguing finding was that five of the top smartphone features (search bar, library hours, my account, room reservation, and floor maps) are all custom web applications that were written in-house and are fully integrated into the RWD. Conversely, several of the least used smartphone features (WorldCat, chat, and eReserve) are third-party applications. In addition, this study found that undergraduate students demonstrated more frequent use and interest in certain website features (e.g., renewal, room reservation, floor maps) than graduate students and faculty members.

We focus on how these trends differ for articles that are highly cited with respect to those that are not. The analyses are based on pairwise title similarity and similarity measures computed from the heterogeneous paper graph, including papers, authors, venues, and topics as nodes. We find that in general as the time passes the citing papers become more dissimilar from the cited paper. Furthermore, highly cited papers get cited by topically more distant papers in all time periods. However, they tend to share venues more than the other groups. In addition, they are less cited by collaborators than less cited papers.

<title> Comparative Investigation of Self-Citation Patterns in Information Science: A Pilot Study
<keywords> self-citation, citation patterns, scholarly communication
<topics> informetrics and scholarly communication
<abstract> This study is an exploratory investigation into the citation patterns in the field of Information Retrieval. Preliminary findings are based on a comparison of self-citation rates in JASIST, a leading journal in Information Retrieval, and a journal in an unrelated field. Although the sample size is small, the preliminary results suggest that there may be irregularities in the self-citation rates among Information Retrieval authors. The exploratory study found that self-citation rate in JASIST is nearly three times that of a journal in an unrelated field. Further study with a more robust sample is warranted to confirm the findings herein and to shed light on the motivations for self-citations.

<title> Online Review Spam Detection by New Linguistic Features
<keywords> Spam Detection, Online Review, Classification, Content Features, Linguistic
<topics> data analytics and evaluation, text/data/knowledge mining
<abstract> With the fast growing and importance of online reviews, malicious users start to abuse the online review websites and deliberately post low quality, untrustworthy, or even fraudulent reviews, which are typically referred to as ``spam reviews''. Many existing studies on review spam detection are based on classification models. Features such as the number of verbs used in the reviews are commonly used to construct the spam review classification model. Surprisingly, many linguistic features of users' reviews have not been thoroughly considered for review spam detection. In this paper, we focus on different types of linguistic features and evaluate their performance on detecting spam reviews. Our empirical evaluation conducted on a spam review benchmark dataset validated the proposed features significantly improve the performance of online review spam detection, reaching more than 93\% accuracy.

<keywords> Citation Analysis, Opinion Mining, Natural Language Processing, Biomedicine
<topics> informetrics and scholarly communication, natural language processing, text/data/knowledge mining
<abstract> This study examines academic opinion expressions in citation context. We first developed an annotation schema to annotate three aspects of each academic opinion expressed in a citation statement: rhetorical purpose, content aspect, and opinion polarity. We then annotated two samples: a natural science sample consisting of biomedical journal articles, and an engineering sample consisting of conference papers in the natural language processing field. A comparison of the annotations on the two samples showed disciplinary differences in citation opinion expressions. The result contributes to the understanding of academic opinion expressions in citation context and the development of automated citation opinion analysis tools to assist researchers' literature search and navigation.

<keywords> participatory design, free and open source software, social informatics, organizations
<topics> human-computer interaction, information technology and work, distributed work
<abstract> There is evidence of a lack of non-developer user involvement and usability problems with free and open source software. Open source software (OSS) 2.0 communities where developers are not the users of the software often have greater commercial and non-profit involvement in the project. As such these types of projects have a greater need to engage non-developer users and are likely to employ more rigorous project software development practices. The study of OSS 2.0 communities provides an opportunity to expand on our understanding of the structures that support involving non-developer users in distributed participatory design. Utilizing the structuralization perspective of technology as the main theoretical foundation, this poster presents initial results from a pilot study of one OSS 2.0 community discussing virtual mediation practices and their effect on users’ involvement with regard to knowledge transfer and influence over design outcomes.

<keywords> Hemingway, Digital, Youth, Participatory, Literacies
<topics> digital humanities, digital youth, education in library and information sciences
<abstract> Who owns Hemingway? The commodification of this literary icon is questioned by a new initiative that asks teens to re-vision Ernest Hemingway as represented by his sister, mother, school friends, and young self. Partnering with the Ernest Hemingway Foundation of Oak Park, with whom the library shares unique stewardship of the Hemingway Archives, Oak Park Public Library has begun a participatory digitization initiative that includes the Illinois State Library and its Illinois Digital Archive, and Oak Park School District 97 to position teens as digital curators. After months of negotiations, never-before-digitized Hemingway artifacts will be situated within local contexts by teens in Hemingway’s hometown; challenging lines of traditional scholarship. The Hemingway Archives have been housed in the library’s museum-grade vaults over a decade, limiting access to the humanities scholarly community; until now. The project focuses on Hemingway's Oak Park: birth-young adulthood (1899-c.1919) with an emphasis on everyday experience; ending with his return after World War I.

<title> Using Social Networks for Library Funding Advocacy: A Discourse Analysis of the Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries Facebook Campaign
<keywords> Network gatekeeping, Public value, Discourse Analysis, Public Libraries, Advocacy
<topics> communication studies, social media, online communities
<abstract> In July 2013, the social media campaign, Save the Miami-Dade Public Libraries (SMDPL) sought to influence the Miami-Dade Mayor and County Commissioners to reverse proposed budget cuts and maintain existing library funding levels. This study examines the SMDPL campaign by conducting a discourse analysis of the SMDPL Facebook posts and Twitter account @MIALibraries to examine the public value statements and interactive policymaking process using Moore’s Creating Public Value Theory. Information sharing using social network sites can be important sources of the wishes of a community but may not direct the actions of public officials and can become a source of community conflict. While the use of SNS may be disruptive in disseminating or implementing an unpopular policy that is desired by public officials and may be an inefficient way to obtain consensus, the pursuit of social equity may outweigh the potential obstacles and challenges facing public officials navigating social networks.

<topics> information services, community informatics, distributed learning
<abstract> Digital badge systems can be contentious to start and challenging to implement. In this project, we examine the development of an open, student-led, peer-to-peer badging framework within an iSchool context. Scaffolds is a dynamic set of digital badges created to give students more concrete guidance in their exploration of the field of information science. The badges provide a way for students to customize their exploration of co-curricular materials and activities to augment their educational experience. Using motivation and perception surveys, as well as in-depth interviews with participants, the goal of this research is to understand what motivates students to participate in digital badges programs and how an open badging platform can be used to encourage student engagement in co-curricular educational activities.

<keywords> Medical Text Analysis, Fuzzy Clustering, Latent Features, LDA, Topic Model
<topics> natural language processing, health informtics, text/data/knowledge mining
<abstract> One of the challenges for text analysis in the medical domain including the clinical notes and research papers is analyzing large-scale medical documents. As a consequence, finding relevant documents has become more difficult and previous work has also shown unique problems of medical documents. The themes in documents help to retrieve documents on the same topic with and without a query. One of the popular methods to retrieve information based on discovering the themes in the documents is topic modeling. In this paper we describe a novel approach in topic modeling, FATM, using fuzzy clustering. To assess the value of FATM, we experiment with two text datasets of medical documents. The quantitative evaluation carried out through log-likelihood on held-out data shows that FATM produces superior performance to LDA. This research contributes to the emerging field of understanding the characteristics of the medical documents and how to account for them in text mining.

<title> Preventing Memory Access Pattern Leakage in Searchable Encryption
<keywords> privacy-enhancing technologies, searchable encryption, oblivious RAM
<topics> information technology and work
<abstract> With the recent popularity of outsourcing private data to the cloud, there is an increased interest in privacy-enhancing technologies. These technologies were developed to maintain the privacy of a user's identity and have evolved alongside the Internet. The current, most popular solution to maintaining the privacy of this data is with encryption. Searchable encryption was developed to allow a user to search an encrypted data repository without decrypting the data first, but it is susceptible to information leakage through memory access patterns. To address the leakages, oblivious RAM obfuscates the memory accesses of data, so that access patterns do not leak information about the stored data. This poster will look at combining oblivious RAM with encrypted search to prevent access pattern leakage and the associated problems, as well as other proposed solutions.

<keywords> data, cyberinfrastructure, ecology, Software-as-a-Service, long-tail
<topics> data science including digital curation and big data, information systems, sustainable computing
<abstract> Biological Field Stations provide a unique set of opportunities and challenges for digital curation. The stations serve as the center of short-term and long-term biological research, from biomolecular-scale to ecosystems-scale research. They represent some of the last remaining “natural” areas in certain regions. Stations provide unique information about local biotic and abiotic conditions. Data shared among the stations support continental scale and global research initiatives. The stations themselves support a large number of researchers who often come from multiple universities and other research and teaching institutions around the world. Because of this decentralized user base, it is particularly difficult for stations to capture data and other research products generated by research at the stations. The authors, part of a larger NSF funded “Empowering Long Tail Research” project (NSF:#1216872), conducted a survey of field station researchers and then held a two-day workshop to identify challenges and opportunities for “grand challenge” research questions that could be enabled through development of cyberinfrastructure. The information gathered through this study will inform future proposals for cyberinfrastructure development.

<topics> qualitative research methods, quantitative analyses including statistics, sustainable computing
<abstract> Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to rise as a result of growth in population and industrialization. Manufacturing of new products with shortened life cycles, like the iPhone, are a significant source of GHG emissions. To identify and analyze potential environmental impacts of the iPhone, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was completed. A survey of iPhone users was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of consumer behavior. As part of this research it has been found that Apple’s design of the iPhone used a strategy of planned obsolescence, resulting in a shorter life cycle, increased mining of rare earth minerals (REMs), higher rates of product turnover, and higher shipping costs and fuel usage. Surveyed iPhone users were largely unaware of Apple’s iPhone recycling program.

<abstract> This current study explores how graduate students make sense together to accomplish real-life collaborative learning tasks. A class of 15 adult students at a large, public university in Northeast US is recruited. The purpose of their learning task is to work with team members and construct group presentations on their collective understandings on information behaviors within specific contexts. Data sources include pre- and post-questionnaires, classroom observations, and in-depth interviews that are structured within Dervin’s (1992) Sense-Making methodology. Our findings identify several task related situations, gaps, and sense-making strategies that incorporate the social dimensions. These social dimensions and emergent collaborative/cooperative learning processes are highlighted and discussed. Overall this study has implications for educators to design socially constructed learning environment and facilitate learners’ sense-making processes when undertaking collaborative tasks.

<abstract> The project is an exploratory network analysis that examines a social movement of African-American women community activists in the attempted establishment of library branch facilities in a public housing community in 1960’s Chicago. The research elevates the activist groups’ efforts in the claiming of information needs for their community. It challenges the privileging of the administrative voice of library decision-making in an urban context, by situating the struggle in an African-American community. The network is created from thirty primary source documents related the social movement. They include newspaper articles, annual reports from the Chicago Public Library, Chicago Public Library Board meeting minutes, and reports and documents from the local community center. The poster demonstrates the effectiveness of analyzing documents through the development of network in order to link relationships, understand the landscape of a social movement, and positioning the library through the lens of the community.

<topics> information organization and metadata, education in library and information sciences, distributed learning
<abstract> Five billion people, as well as rural libraries, schools, and prisons across the globe, are not connected to the Internet. The WiderNet Project attempts to assist these underserved populations with its eGranary Digital Libraries, which make a wide variety of Web resources available offline. Access alone is not enough, however, as an individual’s first exposure to Web resources is much like ‘drinking from a firehose’. Additionally, most of the eGranary’s 32 million resources remain uncatalogued and hence difficult to find. To address this issue, we are experimenting with ‘crowd cataloguing’ to create and cull cataloguing information for eGranary resources. An exploratory study is introduced in which we will draw on lessons learned from folksonomy as well as previous eGranary cataloguing projects. The purpose is to further develop a “Lo-Fi to Hi-Fi” model of eGranary metadata generation that emphasizes improving the metadata literacy of general users and library professionals.

<abstract> This study performs an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the user engagement scale (UES) in the setting of daily life visual information search (i.e. searching images and/or videos using Web-based information systems). Principal Components Factor Analysis was employed to examine the six sub-scales of user engagement while searching images and/or videos on Web-based systems. Results indicated that the most stable sub-scale is Aesthetics (AE) followed by the Focused Attention (FA), while Perceived Usability (PUs) retained two of eight items and Novelty (NO) retained one of three items. Items from Felt Involvement (FI) and Endurability (EN) merged with the remaining items from PUs or NO to form two Factors. A number of 91 college student users responded to an online administered questionnaire in two weeks duration. The findings showed that more than 57% of the users use Google as their first choice to search visual information and YouTube, social media, and special sites were also used for their daily life visual information search.

<abstract> Users with different amount of domain or topic knowledge tend to find different results, when searching on the same topic. We were interested in finding out how domain or topic knowledge is associated with users’ querying behaviors, which would result in different results. In this study, thirty-five students participated in a user experiment, conducted searches from genomics data set that was used by TREC Genomics track 2004. The participants’ background domain knowledge and the knowledge of each individual topics was assessed, before they performed the search tasks. Their querying behaviors were recorded. The results demonstrate that domain knowledge level is significantly associated with the number of search terms in queries: the more knowledgeable, the more search terms. Further analyses are planned to be conducted.

<abstract> With the advancement of communication technology there has been a growing emphasis on international and intercultural communication. Following this trend information science journals have become open to a more internationalized authorship. Although the Internet today has facilitated the infrastructure for scholars to exchange work on a more international level, there may still be other barriers that interfere with a balanced internationalization of IS journals. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the internationality of several high visibility Library and information science journals by studying the permeation of international participation through the exploration of seven indicators: (1) the editorial and advisory boards, (2) peer review boards, (3) their database circulation, (4) authorship, (5) peer review evaluation criteria, (6) internationality of citations, (7) and citation impact.

<keywords> Trusted Timestamping, Crypto Currencies, Bitcoin, Block chain, Cryptography, Web Applications
<topics> information services, archives and records
<abstract> Trusted timestamping is a process for proving that certain information existed at a given point in time. This paper presents a trusted timestamping concept and its implementation in form of a web-based service that uses the decentralized Bitcoin block chain to store anonymous, tamper-proof timestamps for digital content. The service allows users to hash files, such as text, photos or videos, and store the created hashes in the Bitcoin block chain. Users can then retrieve and verify the timestamps that have been committed to the block chain. The non-commercial service enables anyone, e.g., researchers, authors, journalists, students, or artists, to prove that they were in possession of certain information at a given point in time. Common use cases include proving that a contract has been signed, a photo taken, a video recorded, or a task completed prior to a certain date. All procedures maintain complete privacy of the user’s data.

<abstract> Understanding commuters’ perceptions, attitudes, and behavior is an important component of transportation planning and management. Collecting such information using traditional survey or interview methods is costly and burdensome, but mining attitudinal data from social networking media could potentially provide insights into the temporal alignment of public opinion with transportation system dynamics. We demonstrate this potential by examining facets of public posts on Twitter about light rail transit services in Los Angeles in terms of sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and the interaction between posters and retweeters. Results provide new insights into how transit users present themselves and their opinions, engage with government agencies, react to events/policies, and share information with others on social media. We also demonstrate an interactive online interface that transit service providers could use to display and monitor real-time feedback and sentiment along different lines in the area’s light rail system.

<keywords> emotion, image collections, museums, website design
<topics> cultural institutions, information seeking/retrieval, human-computer interaction
<abstract> Artworks are often created to solicit emotional responses, yet the emotional elements are largely missing from artworks’ description and access options. In an effort to advance the design of emotion-based image retrieval systems, our study developed several research proposals for incorporating emotion into the description and access features of a digital artwork collection. Most of the proposed solutions for developing emotion metadata for artworks were informed by the current practices in information organization, including crowdsoursing and expert classifications. Being grounded in various emotion theories, the proposals offer a variety of ways to integrate emotion descriptors and navigation features into the interface design of a museum website. While the proposed solutions for integrating emotion features into online collections are not exhaustive, they highlight some of the design choices for developing emotion metadata, coding schemas and navigation features, and offer innovative ways to engage virtual visitors with museum digital collection.

The popular notions of paradigm and entropy are explored as one discipline seeks to borrow words, terms, and signs from other (frequently more mature and concrete disciplines. At times the original intention is salvaged, but frequently other meaning is substituted—deliberately or not—in the process of appropriation. There are examples of a discipline adopting terms originating in another one, and the challenges that ensue.

<abstract> The advancements and proliferation of mobile networking and computing technology has enabled large-scale collaborations between people towards solving specific problems. While crowdsourcing has been utilized to facilitate various research efforts and a fast growing number of businesses utilizes crowdsourcing approaches in their products, it is only recently that the “wisdom of crowds” has seen applications in civic life and urban planning. Whereas the potentials are huge, successful design and deployment is not trivial. The major challenges that local government offices have to face when using crowdsourcing for urban planning operations are: (i) providing incentives for usage from the city-dwellers, while ensuring the quality of information submitted and (ii) providing accessibility to the corresponding platform for the mass of the population. In this article we provide a qualitative discussion on the potential pitfalls of crowdsourcing in managing and exploiting civic information.

<keywords> Social media; social media use; media consumption; undergraduate students; emotions
<topics> digital youth, qualitative research methods, social media
<abstract> This paper discusses self-perceived observations of social media use among undergraduate students. 132 media diaries are analyzed in order to identify media usage patterns and profiles. The purpose was to go beyond a typical snapshot acquired from a cross-sectional survey design. The students were asked to report in detail of their media use and to reflect on their behavior. The diaries have been analyzed using NVivo with the focus on the explication of the students’ own reflections on their media and social media consumption. Results show four different media consumption profiles. Most of the students were active social media users. An interesting finding is that 17 % of the students experience their social media behavior as problematic and their reflections revealed strong negative emotions. The perception of negative behavior is expressed as a feeling of shame, guilt, and embarrassment.

<title> The New-to-Online Instructor: Conceptions, Desires and Expectations
<keywords> online teaching, phenomenology, novice instructor
<topics> education in library and information sciences, distributed learning
<abstract> This paper presents the findings of a phenomenological investigation of online teaching, as experienced by six faculty members who have never taught online before. The findings demonstrate the qualitatively different (and sometimes similar) ways the participants describe their understanding and experience of online teaching and learning. Insight into these understandings and experiences is achieved through the use of semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Shared experiences were identified through a process of analysis that includes an attempt to understand the experiences and categorize them into clusters of meaning. It is concluded that faculty who are new to online teaching have conceptions, desires and expectations for their teaching experience, which come from prior knowledge as an educator.

<title> Advocacy Organization Affiliations: Alliances and Perceived Common Interests between Socially, Politically, and Informationally Disadvantaged Communities
<keywords> information inequality, coalition structure, strategic alliances, networks
<topics> cultural institutions, social informatics
<abstract> In order to address issues of inequality, advocacy organizations aggregate into coalitions and interest networks which have significant implications for the success of advocacy efforts and impact on the policy making process. Structural and contextual analysis of a link network consisting of advocacy organizations representing the interests of socially, politically, and informationally disadvantaged communities reveals patterns in coalition formation for successful advocacy. Analysis supports advocacy coalition framework-based theories of parallel network structures and advocacy hubs as key nodes for bridge formation across advocacy areas. This preliminary study also explores unanticipated alliances between discrete areas of advocacy and the implications of cross sector alliances. A design for more expansive inquiry is proposed and hypotheses are posited for relationships between information inequality and other asymmetries, which can be tested within advocacy organization networks. Continued analysis of the relationships between advocacy organizations will identify successful coalition structure to inform future advocacy coalition development.

<title> Extending Knowledge Management to ‘Knowing’: A Design of Experience Management System
<keywords> Knowing, experience management system, vignette, design science, conflict management
<topics> information systems, knowledge management, information technology and work
<abstract> Knowing is constituted in, and thus, inseparable from practice. The conceptualization it suggests is different from the epistemology of possession that underlies prior work in knowledge management. To capture, represent and manage ‘knowing,’ we propose a novel class of solutions – experience management systems. An experience management system consists of practice vignettes, vignette representation, and vignette generation. We envision the solution as a challenge to, yet an extension of, the notion of case-based reasoning systems. The paper outlines the kernel theories that contribute to the solution, and illustrate our efforts in the context of conflict management in large-scale projects.

<title> Collective Archiving of Soundscapes in Socio-Cultural Context
<keywords> soundscape, acoustic communication, sound maps, linked data, ontology
<topics> communication studies, cultural informatics, archives and records
<abstract> Soundscape research aims to draw public awareness to the acoustic environment and to enhance our auditory experience. With the help of advances in audio technology, field recording and archiving of environmental sounds are getting popular among researchers and artists. Moreover emerging Web technologies promote various web-based sound projects such as collaborative sound archives, sound maps, and other experimental projects. These projects present innovative approach to soundscape research particularly improving user experience. However, the social and cultural contexts emanated by soundscapes are still buried in an unorganized way. The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction and overview of soundscape research and to discuss the possibility of the Semantic Web technologies to link soundscape research with social and cultural contexts. We also suggest a preliminary design for the Soundscape Ontology to lead future research on conserving and managing soundscape as resources in the information system.

<title> User Perceptions of Associative Thesaural Relationships: A Preliminary Study
<keywords> associative relationships; Library of Congress Subject Headings; crowdsourcing; controlled vocabularies; thesauri
<topics> information organization and metadata
<abstract> This study investigates whether potential library users can identify distinctions of associative relationships in Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) and whether they perceive such relationships as useful. This work tests previous presumptions about user needs and capabilities regarding associative relationships. It lays a foundation for an interconnected network of subject relationships to navigate both libraries and the Web. Using sample related term pairs sourced, potential library users on Amazon Mechanical Turk were asked to identify narrower distinctions of established associative relationship types. Results indicate that some associative relationship types, especially near-synonymous/frequently interchangeable terms, are easily identifiable while others, like position in time and space, remain problematic. Despite an inclination against library catalog use, potential library users do perceive associative relationships as useful and suggest a variety of additional associative relationship types. For some users, the type of associative relationship may be less important than relationship closeness or proximity.

<title> Understanding User Behavior on Online Music Distribution Sites: A Discourse Approach
<keywords> Computer-mediated discourse analysis, speech act analysis, music distribution sites, user behavior
<topics> communication studies, human information behavior, quantitative analyses including statistics
<abstract> We analyze user behavior on two music distribution websites, SoundCloud.com and Last.fm, using a computer-mediated discourse analysis approach. The broad goal is to infer patterns of use that can inform the development of system/site designs to facilitate communication among online users. The specific goal is to analyze the actions users perform through comments posted to the sites. Based on a manually-coded sample of 49,324 comments, we address two research questions: What are the most common speech acts used in comments on the music distribution sites, and how, if at all, do design differences – between the two sites and between the two commenting modes available on SoundCloud – affect speech act use? From these comparisons, we identify site purpose (SoundCloud as a music sharing site, Last.fm as a music streaming site) and commenting mode (regular vs. timed comments) as important factors that contribute to the characteristics of user comments, and suggest implications of these findings for the design of music distribution sites.

<topics> qualitative research methods, cultural informatics
<abstract> The under-representation of Blacks in the information technology (IT) profession is a longstanding issue. The purpose of this study is to understand the factors that influence Black male college students to pursue IT careers. This paper presents the results of interviews with 27 Black males majoring in IT at a historically black university. Four themes (community encouragement, exposure to computing, hustler’s ambition, “New Black”) emerged as particularly useful for understanding IT career choice. These findings have practical implications for designing effective interventions that broaden the participation of under-represented groups in the IT workforce, as well as scholarly implications for the conduct of research on academic achievement and IT career choice of successful Black males.

We also begin to draw out the interrelations between local and global spaces and infrastructures; and to ground amorphous ‘big’ data infrastructures in local sites and cultures of production."

<title> Targeted Query Expansions as a Method for Searching Mixed Quality Digitized Cultural Heritage Documents
<keywords> digitization, OCR, cultural heritage, IR
<topics> cultural institutions, information seeking/retrieval, archives and records
<abstract> Digitization of cultural heritage is a huge ongoing effort in many countries. In digitized historical documents, words may occur in different surface forms due to three types of variation - morphological variation, historical variation, and errors in optical character recognition (OCR). Because individual documents may differ significantly from each other regarding the level of such variations, digitized collections may contain documents of mixed quality. Such different types of documents may require different types of retrieval methods. We suggest using targeted query expansions (QE) to access documents in mixed-quality text collections. In QE the user-given search term is replaced by a set of expansion keys (search words); in targeted QE the selection of expansion terms is based on the type of surface level variation occurring in the particular text searched. We illustrate our approach in a highly inflectional compounding language, Finnish while the variation occur across all natural languages. We report a minimal-scale experiment based on the QE method and discuss the need to support targeted QEs in the search interface.

<abstract> Students have access to a wealth of digital information resources from a wide range of publishers. This paper introduces a preliminary analysis of focus group data that asked graduate students in the U.K. how they used a range of library and non-library tools and services to seek information for class projects. The findings suggest a mental model of graduate student information practice is built on a ‘whatever works’ approach rather than any deep knowledge of technical information seeking practices. This model does not differentiate significantly between different services and tools, and has as its goal getting (retrieving) and using (deploying) information in support of various aspects of student life.

<title> Thematic Analysis of Words that Invoke Values in the Net Neutrality Debate
<keywords> human values, Net neutrality, thematic analysis, automated content analysis, natural language processing
<topics> social informatics, information/computing ethics
<abstract> This paper describes an initial analysis of the association of specific vocabulary choices with the invocation of human values in testimonies prepared for public hearings about Net neutrality in the United States. Motivation for this work comes from an interest in understanding what people value and how they express those values in writing. Related work includes research on human values from fields ranging from social psychology to advertising to human-computer interaction. First, human annotators used closed coding to identify human values in testimonies based on a prior meta-analysis of human values. Next, a “values dictionary” was automatically learned that identifies words that are strongly associated with sentences that human annotators coded as being related to specific values. Finally, an open-ended thematic analysis was conducted. The contribution of the paper is to enhance our understanding of how human values are expressed, as well as to introduce and evaluate a new automated tool for facilitating social science research.

<topics> human information behavior, community informatics
<abstract> This paper presents the results of an exploratory study of information behaviors among undocumented migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Through semi-structured interviews with recently deported and other migrants at a shelter in the border town of Nogales, Mexico, we examine how undocumented migrants are seeking, acquiring, understanding, and using information prior to, and during, migration across the U.S.-Mexico border. We document the prevalence of word-of-mouth information seeking and use of cell phones over other information technologies to inform plans for border-crossing, and explore the ambivalent nature of information technology use in the vulnerable setting of life at the border. We discuss the use of mobile phones, which help meet the migrants’ communication needs and also increase their exposure to crime and abuse. This research informs a broader research agenda on immigration and information, contributes to a philosophical discussion about the morality of ICT use in the context of undocumented migration, and explores the notion of immigrant transnationalism as it applies to the experience of undocumented migration at the U.S.-Mexico border.

<abstract> Starting in 2015, Opus will be the information system of record for faculty at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Opus will serve as both a profile system, storing data about faculty work, and as workflow engine for the promotion and tenure process. Opus leverages institutional master data wherever possible to collect data about faculty activity. Repurposing institutional data collected for purposes not related to academic review necessitates allowing data subjects, faculty, to contextualize the data for the review process. Displaying and storing these augmented records (master data with manually added metadata from “non-authoritative” sources) has forced to project team to grapple with questions regarding fairness and transparency to both data subjects and to data consumers. How can we hold to “good design” and usability practices, while faithfully representing the inherent “messiness” of the data? How does the context in which the data was collected impact repurposing the data for academic review? This paper outlines our attempts to address these questions, noting the trade-offs and limitations of the selected solutions.

<abstract> Comparative research on data practices is hampered by the difficulty of studying across cases. The Republic of Ireland, with its small geographical size and population, an economy that is highly leveraged in information technology investment, and a centralized funding model provides a unique “laboratory” for examining data infrastructures in social and cultural contexts. This project reports on a preliminary study of the Open Data movement in the Irish public sector with an eye to surfacing themes for understanding data practices and challenges across different sectors. Using semi-structured interviews with individuals (n=11) involved in open data administration across the Republic, the researchers discuss current implementation and ongoing practices. Initial findings with respect to difficulties in measuring success, the sustainability of data, and valuating data are discussed. Future work on understanding how culture may play a role in open data infrastructures, stated and implicit values and biases, and creating and measuring need and impact are briefly discussed.

<topics> ICT4D (information and communication technology for development)
<abstract> We argue that study of Latin America, largely absent from the current English-language information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) literature, poses the literature’s best promise for addressing its biggest shortfall: a dearth of theory. Studies based in Latin America can address this shortfall in theory by adopting the lens of political economy, which brings the region’s political, social, and cultural factors into sharp relief. These political, social, and cultural factors are exactly what ICT4D studies must examine if they are to build predictive theory of project success. We document the absence of Latin American studies in the ICT4D literature, pose possible explanations for this absence, detail why Latin America holds promise for addressing the literature’s theoretical problems, and outline tasks for future research to reap this promise.

<topics> information technology and work, online communities, infrastructure studies
<abstract> Science now relies on mid-level infrastructure, including shared instruments, cell lines, supercomputing resources, data sets, and software components. These are beyond the facilities and services traditionally provided by individual universities; funding agencies such as the NSF often support their initial creation but their long-term sustainability is a challenge and commercialization is only rarely an option. A promising model, though, is broad-based community support through peer production, often inspired by the organization of open source software projects. Such transitions, though, are not automatic or easy, just as commercialization is not. In this research I am studying successful and unsuccessful attempts to transition, building theory and practical guidance for scientists and funding agencies. In this work-in-progress paper, I present the motivation and background for the study and provide motivation through preliminary description of my first case study.

This paper reports on a qualitative study of historical and current data practices at the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, which is seeking wider understanding of the historical dimensions of specimen metadata, in order to support migration to more global standards. A detailed case study of a single specimen shows how that specimen has been described in multiple ways and in multiple locations within the Academy, and the historically complex nature of the data and metadata contained in these descriptions.

<keywords> Chinese healthcare; Healthcare referral services; Knowledge sharing; Patient-centred healthcare; Patient knowledge
<topics> health informtics, knowledge management
<abstract> This paper reports on an ongoing research project, which aims to identify, explain and resolve knowledge sharing (KS) barriers in Chinese healthcare referral services. Specifically, this paper presents and discusses the critical literature review performed at the beginning of this project, which aimed to establish the theoretical basis for the empirical stages. The review included three types of documentation, namely: academic contributions, grey literature, and organisational and procedural documentation. 207 academic articles were systematically retrieved, selected and analysed. The grey literature review included national and regional policy and governance documentation. Procedural literature review included documents and guidelines from two hospitals and one community healthcare centre. Grey and procedural literature review was used to establish the process of referral whilst the academic literature review was used to identify potential KS barriers. The research findings point to 13 KS barriers, which emerged in five themes. This paper provides a perspective on the development of KS in Chinese hospitals and provides valuable implications for healthcare KS researchers and practitioners around the world.

<topics> human-computer interaction, sustainable computing
<abstract> Most research in computing and information science reinforces the premise that information and communications technology (ICT) can be productively applied even more broadly than it is at present. A recent thread of research in sustainable HCI, however, has focused on the possibility that there are many situations where less ICT, not more, may be desirable. We envision an adaptation of this premise, where the goal is not just to consciously omit or remove ICT systems, but rather to create systems explicitly designed to make themselves superfluous through their use. Such a system—one in which the successful operation of the system in the short term renders it superfluous in the long term—could be called a “self-obviating system”. We present a case study in the sustainable food domain for a context in which self-obviating systems could be useful, and a typology of self-obviating systems that could be relevant to other domains. Self-obviating systems could be an important part of a sustainable future, and could be applied more broadly in ICT design.

<topics> social media, knowledge management, online communities
<abstract> Mendeley website is a representative academic social networking service. We aim to study how papers are shared in the public groups in Mendeley. The results show that 61.58% of the public groups were extremely small in size, containing only one member (the creator of the group). When it comes to paper sharing, 26.88% of the groups had no papers added to them. Large groups did exist, i.e. the groups having more than 1,170 members. Groups with large amount of papers also existed, i.e. groups having as many as 90,458 papers. On the other hand, there are top groups with high averages of paper readership; interestingly, these groups had small numbers of members and papers, both below 20. From the results of this research, the truth of online ecology on Mendeley website could be revealed. Taking an insight into the current condition helps group owners activate their groups, and also helps operators of Mendeley make decisions on improving services. Those improvements would make Mendeley a more advanced social platform for scholarly knowledge communication.

In an effort to determine if one Florida Panhandle community college was delivering its intended IT education goals and meeting the needs of local employers, the researchers performed five comparative analyses that stemmed from the overarching research question, “How do IT program learning outcomes compare to the requirements of IT job postings as well as to IT student and faculty perceptions of what is learned and what is taught?” The results of this study, when contextualized with extant literature, suggest that schools are challenged in aligning curricula with IT employers needs especially in clarifying the value of certifications and obtaining meaningful experiential learning opportunities for students as they manage their education and career pathways.

<abstract> Through this paper we identify systemic challenges that face efforts to ethically steward collections of trauma in a conflict-ridden world. Our scholarly reflections are grounded in the context of a centre being created to hold materials related to Canada’s ongoing Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We report on initial discussions with those involved in the Centre’s development and our ongoing review of court documents and media accounts related to the Centre. We call attention to the amalgamation of socio-technical, political, and legal structures that influence the actions of those managing collections of trauma. We highlight how those involved in the Centre’s development (including the researchers) are participants in and descendants of Canada’s legacy of colonizing initiatives. We identify generative frictions related to issues of conflict, plurality, agency, and distrust that underlie the design and management of collections of trauma. These reflections guide our ongoing investigation.

<topics> cultural institutions, information organization and metadata, cultural informatics
<abstract> Since the advent of Linked Data (LD) in circa 2006, the participation of many institutions in publishing their data online has led to rapid growth of a Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. In the library field, major libraries from countries around the world have become aware of the value of LOD and are making an effort to publish the quality metadata that they hold as LOD. The National Library of Korea (NLK) joined this movement in 2012. With the quantitative increase in LOD, it has become necessary to build LOD-based application services both to enable more institutions to participate in publishing LOD and to provide real benefits to users. This paper describes the LOD data model of the National Library of Korea, the core of its developing LOD-based application service and planned interface. The paper evaluates and discusses the anticipated effects of the new system for its target audience.

<title> A Pricing Model for Data Markets
<keywords> data valuation, data markets, pricing model, machine learning, regression
<topics> data science including digital curation and big data, information policy and open access, quantitative analyses including statistics
<abstract> As companies and organizations explore the booming frontier of data, they operate in data markets that are largely unregulated. One of the foremost challenges within these emerging markets is establishing an accepted methodology for assessing the value of datasets. Current data pricing strategies are often driven by the seller, with little visibility into the cost of collection, cleansing and packaging to the buyer. This asymmetry of information results in a lack of pricing transparency; hurting the seller, who is then unable to price optimally in the market, and hurting the buyer, who then cannot strategically assess pricing options across data service providers. A more structured data market with a standardized pricing model would improve the transaction experience for all parties. In this paper, we describe a potential dataset valuation model and the impact such a model would have on data markets. We also explore how the model would assist with adding proprietary datasets as assets on corporate balance sheets,and with the formation of a futures market for data.

<title> On the Relationship between Open Access and Altmetrics
<keywords> altmetrics, open access, research evaluation, Google Scholar
<topics> information policy and open access, informetrics and scholarly communication, social media
<abstract> A new and diverse set of online metrics are emerging to capture the effects of the sharing and discussion of research articles on online platforms. In this paper, we investigate whether altmetrics differ between Open Access (OA) and Non-Open Access (NOA) articles. We define a new metric, the Open Access Altmetric Advantage, and investigate 14 online data sources (Twitter, Facebook, CiteULike, Mendeley, F1000, blogs, mainstream news outlets, Google Plus, Pinterest, Reddit, Sina Weibo, the peer review sites PubPeer and Publons, policy documents, and sites running Stack Exchange (Q&A)). In eight of the data sources investigated, we found that OA articles receive higher altmetrics than NOA articles; however, we found less significant differences when taking into consideration some influential factors such as journal, publication year, and citation count.

<abstract> Both data-driven and human-centric methods have been used to better understand the scientific process. We describe a new framework called evidence-based discovery, to reconcile the gulf between the data-driven and human-centered approaches. Our goal is to provide a vision statement for how these (and other) approaches can be unified in order to better understand the complex-decision making that occurs when creating new knowledge. Despite the inevitable challenges, the combination of data and human-centric methods are required to understand, characterize, and ultimately accelerate science.

<abstract> Before the coherent internetworking protocol that enables the Internet today, machines called gateways ‘translated’ between dissimilar networks, at first in the early 1970s with great difficulty, and, by the early 1980s, comparatively seamlessly. This paper investigates some of the historical processes that drew multiple, formerly incompatible networks into a single logical network. Studying these processes can illustrate the Internet’s historical contingency -- and the labor that was required to overcome the social and technical differences governing the multiple, independent networks that came to, and now comprise, the Internet.

<title> Emerging Insights on Building Infrastructure for Data-Driven Transparency and Accountability of Organizations
<keywords> data, information infrastructure, accountability, organizational practice, performance improvement
<topics> data science including digital curation and big data, social informatics, infrastructure studies
<abstract> Diverse domains including education, healthcare, and business are attempting to harness IT and data science to govern individual and organizational performance. Largely centered on performance measurement, data-driven accountability tools are used to engineer work processes according to best practices and transfer policy to practice through tying quantitative outcomes to consequential valuation schemes. In this early work, we present preliminary insights from a multi-sited ethnography of ongoing development of infrastructure for data science being developed for purposes of organizational accountability in the healthcare. The aim is to describe key concerns in the design of ‘infrastructure for accountability’ (consisting of the array IT, organizations, organizational relationships, standards, and roles being developed to undergird performance measurement). Some initial considerations for design of infrastructure for accountability include dual functions of the data, communication hierarchy, emergent seams, and bridging installed bases and communities of practice. This research has implications for researchers, designers, and managers of infrastructure for accountability, as well contributing ethnographic empirical insights into social and organizational implications of creating the data-driven world.

<title> Mysterious Influential Users in Political Communication on Twitter: Users’ Occupation Information and Its Impact on Retweetability
<keywords> Political Communication, Twitter, Retweet, Social Media, Influential User
<topics> communication studies, human information behavior, social media
<abstract> This study attempts to examine the effect of user’s self-disclosed identification to measure his influence and activity on Twitter. By looking at the most frequently shared top 1076 tweets written by 250 users during the 2012 presidential election campaign South Korea, we particularly examine the relation between user’s occupation information and the measures of his ‘influence’: the number of followers and number of retweets by others. Influential users in South Korean political communication network on Twitter are classified as one group with self-disclosed occupation information and the other group without that information. User’s occupation information clearly shows the impact on the number of followers for both groups. On the other hand, user group without self-disclosed occupation information has a higher level of producing influential political tweets and wide retweetability over the other group, regardless the small number of followers. It suggests that further study needs to identify other variables that may influence particular user or tweet’s retweetability as an indicator of influence.

<keywords> Social Media, Crime, Predictive Analysis, GIS, Spatial Correlation

<abstract> To support a dissertation proposal a link between social media, incident-based crime data, and data of public domain needed to be verified. A predictive crime-based artifact utilizing data mining and natural language processing techniques commingled with graphical information system architecture is complex. With respect to social media, an attempt was made to observe such an artifact’s data flexibility, process control, and predictive capabilities. Data and their capabilities were observed when preprocessing social media’s noisy data, government-based structured data, and obscurely collected field data for use in a predictive GIS artifact. To support project goals the approach for artifact design, data collection, and discussion of results was couched as an exploratory study. Results indicate a link between social media data and domain specific datasets exist. Questions for further observation and research deal with processing the subtle differences between structured and noisy data, weighted social media input layers, and time-series analysis.

<abstract> The purpose of this session is to introduce participants to the engaging and adaptable “Draw My Life” video as a form of digital storytelling and professional reflection. Garnering millions of Youtube views, Draw My Life videos and their related conversations exemplify the participatory content creation and sharing enabled by today’s content creation tools and social media spaces. Draw My Life videos employ fast-motion video apps, typically on mobile devices, to capture narration and stick figure sketching of important life moments. With seemingly simple drawings, individuals use this forum to explore meaningful events, turning points, and lessons learned, in compelling, insightful, and sometimes very personal digital stories. Participants will view and discuss sample videos, learn about and practice tools for building Draw My Life stories, and construct a Draw My Life story. During the session, participants will also identify and discuss the literacies that these digital, reflective stories foster, including digital media and storytelling skills, participatory culture in the Youtube sharing context, and dispositions of self-reflection and metacognition.

<title> 21st Century Information Workers: What Core Competencies Should MSIS Students Learn?
<keywords> Information work, education, curriculum, core competencies in information studies
<topics> education in library and information sciences
<abstract> The day-to-day work of information workers charged with information creation, organization, presentation, preservation, analysis, and retrieval is changing dramatically because of rapid advances in technology, the ubiquitous availability of information, and the increasing diversity and globalization of users, patrons, and co-workers. Further, the jobs themselves are changing, such that information workers are not likely to focus on one traditional information task, but must integrate other knowledge and skills, such as data analysis (with large data) and social media. The array of jobs and tasks leads us to ask: what are the core competencies for all information studies students? The authors conducted a survey of more than 2,000 information professionals focusing on six information work roles (archivy, data analysis, librarianship, records/digital assets management, social media, and user experience) to find out about their day-to-day work and their recommendations for formal curriculum. In this special session, we will organize a lively discussion debating professionals’ conflicting recommendations for formal iSchool curriculum.

<abstract> Conferences provide opportunities for participants to learn with each other through social discovery, interaction and knowledge development. Increasingly, Twitter provides an online backchannel surrounding conference activities. This backchannel both augments in-person interactions, and provides a means for people not in attendance to follow and contribute to the dialogue.

Given that conferences are a forum in which interactive learning takes place, how might Twitter participation at conferences facilitate learning? This session intends to initiate a collaborative dialogue around this inquiry using Twitter as a catalyst, complementing the existing iConference Twitter backchannel. This exploration will focus on content and network analysis methods, discussions on learning networks, and ideation around Twitter as a learning tool.

<abstract> This workshop introduces participants to trace ethnography, building a network of scholars interested in the collection and interpretation of trace data and distributed documentary practices. The intended audience is broad, and participants need not have any existing experience working with trace data from either qualitative or quantitative approaches. The workshop provides an interactive introduction to the background, theories, methods, and applications–present and future–of trace ethnography. Participants with more experience in this area will demonstrate how they apply these techniques in their own research, discussing various issues as they arise. The workshop is intended to help researchers identify documentary traces, plan for their collection and analysis, and further formulate trace ethnography as it is currently conceived. In all, this workshop will support the advancement of boundaries, theories, concepts, and applications in trace ethnography, identifying the diversity of approaches that can be assembled around the idea of ‘trace ethnography’ within the iSchool community.

<title> Sociotechnical Approaches to Fieldwork and Trace Data Integration (Session 1)
<keywords> Sociotechnical, CSST
<topics> cultural institutions, human information behavior, social media, social computing
<abstract> The 2015 Sociotech Workshop focuses attention to the possibilities of leveraging trace data (data that is created from the use or presence of digital artifacts and interactions) with data collected through fieldwork. This combination is sociotechnical both in its form and value to better engaging human/ machine interactions. To this end, the workshop provides a forum for: (1) introducing scholars to the basic conceptual premises of sociotechnical scholarship; (2) sociotech scholars to advance their own work and thinking relative to the opportunities of combining the various types of evidence gathered through fieldwork with the range of trace data possibilities that are emerging. Like the seven previous pre-iConference Sociotech Workshops, this event also provides participants an introduction to the Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems (CSST). The CSST serves a trans-disciplinary community, connecting like-minded scholars from many different intellectual communities whose interests are towards the mutual constitution of social and technological phenomena. A 250-word position paper is due March 9; see the iConference workshop web page for details.

<keywords> social media, data analysis, gender, sexuality, race
<topics> data analytics and evaluation, social media, cultural informatics, social computing, text/data/knowledge mining
<abstract> We present a full day, hands-on workshop that will provide an opportunity for researchers in our community to explore social media data and ask questions about the intersectionalities of gender, race, and sexuality. We will discuss scholarly questions and methods related to application of social media data analysis and the implications of using, presenting, and communicating results in research contexts. Workshop participants will learn how to access and analyze data using various tools and methods, drawing specifically on a Twitter dataset collected May-June 2014 during the trending hashtag #YesAllWomen. Selected participants will also present their own work to foster opportunities for targeted discussion and continued collaboration. The goals of this workshop are not only to build community but also to enable researchers to begin collecting and analyzing social media data to further their own work. The workshop emphasizes the importance of analyzing social media data ethically, respecting and engaging the sometimes vulnerable and marginalized populations who may have generated the data.

<title> Trace Ethnography Workshop (Session 2)
<keywords> trace ethnography, trace data, research methods
<topics> data analytics and evaluation, qualitative research methods, social media, quantitative analyses including statistics, infrastructure studies
<abstract> This workshop introduces participants to trace ethnography, building a network of scholars interested in the collection and interpretation of trace data and distributed documentary practices. The intended audience is broad, and participants need not have any existing experience working with trace data from either qualitative or quantitative approaches. The workshop provides an interactive introduction to the background, theories, methods, and applications–present and future–of trace ethnography. Participants with more experience in this area will demonstrate how they apply these techniques in their own research, discussing various issues as they arise. The workshop is intended to help researchers identify documentary traces, plan for their collection and analysis, and further formulate trace ethnography as it is currently conceived. In all, this workshop will support the advancement of boundaries, theories, concepts, and applications in trace ethnography, identifying the diversity of approaches that can be assembled around the idea of ‘trace ethnography’ within the iSchool community.

<title> On the Role of Engagement in Information Seeking Contexts: From Research to Implementation (Session 2)
<keywords> user engagement; emotion; measurement; design; information retrieval and seeking
<topics> information seeking/retrieval, human-computer interaction
<abstract> "This workshop will provide a forum for researchers, practitioners and developers interested in user engagement and emotion in the context of information systems design and use. Specifically, we seek to address questions such as “How do we ensure that the measurement of subjective user experiences is robust and scalable?”, “How do we design for engaging and emotionally compelling experiences?”, and “How do we prevent disengagement?” The ability to answer these questions relies upon: a solid

<type> conceptual understanding of subjective experiences; robust, scalable approaches to measuring engagement; and the ability to utilize this knowledge in information systems design. This three-part workshop will include: talks by the organizers to ground the workshop’s themes; position paper presentations and design exemplars from attendees, and an interactive session focused on design scenarios and prototyping. The intersection of emotion and engagement with measurement and design in information seeking contexts is a timely issue for the iSchool community."

<topics> data analytics and evaluation, information visualization
<abstract> iSchools have been offering visualization courses and developing programs in data science. The practice of visualization requires expertise in a diverse range of skills including design, data curation and coding, all of which leverage iSchool strengths. Thus, iSchools have a unique opportunity to develop curricula suited for data scientists that leverage iSchool strengths. During this half day, fishbowl style workshop, conference goers interested in visualization education at information schools will be invited to explore themes related to the inclusion of information and data visualization coursework in iSchool data science curricula. Workshop organizers represent several diverse disciplines with interest in applied visualization practices and collectively have a range of experiences using visualizations in research and teaching visualization in the classroom.

<keywords> information ethics, professional responsibility, information policy, education
<topics> history, theory and philosophy of information, information policy and open access, education in library and information sciences, information/computing ethics
<abstract> Information professionals manage, organize, preserve, create, design, implement, and control the information systems, services, goods, and devices that are both ubiquitous in and essential to our daily existence. But where there is great power, there is also great responsibility. Recent events suggest that information professionals may benefit from enhanced education and training to prepare them to respond to the ethical challenges they will encounter in their work in socially responsible ways. Improving information ethics education is one step toward beginning to build a strong foundation in this space moving forward. Participants in this workshop will explore and identify key principles, tensions, and themes in the emerging field of information ethics and collaborate on the creation of an open model course syllabus.
